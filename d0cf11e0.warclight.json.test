                    "Dear [INSERT CANDIDATE NAME], As mayor of [INSERT CITY/TOWN/VILLAGE NAME], I am writing to you about your party\u2019s stance on a number of important issues facing Saskatchewan\u2019s urban municipalities \u2014 our hometowns. Our province\u2019s urban municipalities are the engines of economic growth. From cities and towns to villages and resort villages to northern municipalities, our communities have the greatest potential to drive growth and provide opportunity. While this is a federal election campaign, I strongly believe that local issues are federal issues, as strong urban municipalities are the foundation for a strong national economy. Federal governments need to work with our communities to: a) empower municipalities to ensure our communities are safe, affordable, provide a high standard of living, and attract investment and jobs; b) provide proper funding to build modern and climate-resistant infrastructure and ensure existing infrastructure meets national standards; c) increase access to affordable housing; and d) allow municipalities to plan and monitor their changing communities and ensure they receive accurate per capita funding from other orders of government through the return of the long-form census. Our community, alongside others across Saskatchewan \u2014 and indeed the nation \u2014 believes there are several key areas where the federal government could make the biggest impact on the future success of our communities, and in turn, our residents. We are interested in hearing where your party stands on the following issues: ISSUE: Public Safety 1) Allocating targeted funding to municipalities so they can make the improvements required by new federal regulations to improve rail safety (including grade-crossing improvements) introduced in the wake of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic disaster, in turn increasing rail safety nationwide. 2) Reopening the Canadian Emergency Management College to provide comprehensive, collaborative and inter-jurisdictional training for municipal and provincial emergency responders. 3) Reinvesting in the Joint Emergency Preparedness Project (JEPP) to ensure municipal fire departments and other emergency responders have access to the equipment required to respond to emergencies as safely and effectively as possible. 4) Providing communities with access to national climate research and risk assessment tools, as well as funding to build and adapt climate resilient infrastructure. 5) Expanding the National Disaster Mitigation Program to include ALL natural disasters, to allow direct application from municipalities, and to fund larger mitigation and infrastructure resiliency projects. 6) Reversing recent threshold changes to the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangement Program to prevent the downloading of response and recovery costs onto municipalities by provinces and territories. ISSUE: INFRASTRUCTURE 1) Creating a new long-term dedicated federal fund of $300 million annually for 20 years to municipalities to help with the cost of replacing or retrofitting municipal wastewater treatment facilities to meet new federal regulatory requirements. 2) Introducing a new permanent, long-term, sustainable, and predictable infrastructure program that increases the overall amount of funding available for municipal infrastructure projects, does not limit the types of projects that can be funded, and allows municipalities to choose priority projects. ISSUE: QUALITY OF LIFE 1) Maintaining the federal government\u2019s current commitment from the 2015-16 budget to spend more than $2.3 billion per year over the next four years to help ensure Canadians in need have access to affordable housing. 2) Establishing a Northern Affordable Housing Program that is focused on communities affected by resource development to alleviate pressure on existing housing, and to provide access to affordable housing for labourers employed in the resource sector in these areas. 3) Initiating an inquiry or round table on missing and murdered aboriginal women as per the resolution passed at SUMA\u2019s 110th Annual Convention. ISSUE: LONG-FORM MANDATORY CENSUS 1) Reinstating the mandatory long-form census to ensure municipalities have access to accurate data for analyzing infrastructure needs; planning and monitoring the changing needs of their communities; and ensuring they receive appropriate per capita funding from federal and provincial governments. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to hearing more about your party\u2019s stance on these issues. They are vital to our urban municipalities \u2014 our hometowns and yours \u2014 and the very people you will serve, should you have the honour of being elected to the House of Commons on October 19. Sincerely, Mayor [INSERT NAME] [CITY/TOWN/VILLAGE] of [NAME]"

                    "The Majority, or the Minority? Because democracies have a multi-party system, it is difficult sometimes to come to a common agreement. There will be choices to be made between different leaders and policies in this multi-party system. Generally speaking, the government acts on the wishes of the majority over the minority, and by doing this, is following majority rule. There are, however, limits to what the majority can do. Because a democracy means a government by consent of the people, it must respect the rights of the other individuals who make up the minority. Majorities, in a democracy cannot \u2022 prevent certain individuals from expressing their viewpoints, even if those viewpoints differ from the majority \u2022 destroy the freedoms of individuals just because they are not part of the majority \u2022 punish a minority for not going along with the larger group \u2022 give individuals more privileges than others because they are part of the majority Minority groups in Canada have to be respected and taken into consideration when making decisions that involve them. In a dictatorship, the government practises a style where the individual is made to follow the wishes of the group. Minority and individual rights are not protected. In fact, dissidents are dealt with severely, even though many of the rights of individuals and minority rights are written up in a constitution. 1. Explain in your own words the meaning of majority rule and minority rights. Provide an example (make one up). ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2. A dissident is someone who does not support what others may support. In a democracy this is acceptable; a citizen may criticize but cannot use violence to bring about change. How are dissidents dealt with in a dictatorship? ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3. From the debate, what evidence is there to suggest that our system is not perfect in dealing with minority groups? ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4. Identify three examples where minority rights must be protected against possible abuse by majority rule. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5. Suppose you are a representative of the government in Canada. You are on a committee deciding whether smoking should be permitted in restaurants. Using the principal of majority rule/minority rights, how could you best deal with the issue? ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ It's all fine to say that the majority decisions will prevail, and the minority will just have to go along with it. Minority groups have rights too. What happens when the minority resorts to extreme action to get its views known? Read the following excerpt to find out. A Delicate Balance1 Rule of the Majority Another complication in the democratic system is the fact that it is based on rule by the majority. Obviously, all the people won't vote for the same candidate, but if most of the people choose one particular person then that is the one elected. Clearly, some voters will not have had their way. So what happens then? Simply, those people in the minority must respect the rules of the system as the majority wants it. In a democracy, however, the minority must retain the right to express its dissatisfaction by whatever legal means it can. It is actually its duty to protest. How else can the government represent both sides and keep the country in balance? There has to be a balance if democracy is to work a balance between all the wishes and all the people. That balance depends on the minority's respect for the law, on its right to protest against the law, and on the government's ability to be sensitive to the differences between opposing groups of people. In Canada that balance becomes more and more difficult to maintain as regions of the country face large but different problems. What happens when serious conflicts occur between the rule of the majority and the protest of the minority? What happens when a protest against harsh laws of discrimination threatens the safety of the community? What happens to democracy when the peaceful demonstration turns into a riot? Where is \"the right of everyone to do his own thing\" then? In a democracy, the government's first duty is to protect the freedom and safety of the majority of its citizens. So the police are there to enforce the law and to protect private and public property. But when does the use of police force indicate a breakdown of democracy? The October Crisis There are many examples of what happens when a minority resorts to violence to make itself heard. However, few examples are better than what happened in Montreal in October 1970. A British diplomat, James Cross, was kidnapped by five revolutionaries, members of the Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ). Their goal was to proclaim in this loud and dangerous voice that the French in our country are second-class citizens. A few days later, a similar group confused the already tragic situation by kidnapping and eventually murdering Pierre Laporte, the Quebec Labour Minister. Even a democracy couldn't handle this kind of protest without resorting to undemocratic methods. The Trudeau government met this particular challenge with startling authority, by passing the War Measures Act. It was martial law police all across the land suddenly had incredible power, to arrest and detain anyone by any method, without trial or explanation. Many of the mass arrests did more to alienate even the innocent majority than they helped to curb the situation in Montreal. And they didn't prevent a murder. This was not democracy. 1 Canada and the World for the excerpt from Canada and the World \"A Delicate Balance,\" by Rolf Lockwood, November 1976, pp. 22-23.

                    "Seminar on effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests 2 December 2013, Conference ROOM XVIII, Geneva \u2013 Switzerland CONCEPT NOTE I. INTRODUCTION 1. In its Resolution 22/10 of 21 March 2013, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize, before the 25th session of the Council, a seminar on \u2018effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests, with the participation of States, relevant Council special procedures, members of the treaty bodies and other stakeholders, including academic experts and civil society representatives, with the aim of building upon the above-mentioned report of the High Commissioner and other related work of the Council; [and to] \u2026 prepare a report on the deliberations held during the seminar and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session\u2019. II. BACKGROUND Human Rights Council resolutions and decisions 2. The Human Rights Council has adopted several resolutions pertinent to the issue of peaceful protests in recent years: \u00b7 In Resolution 12/16 of 2 October 2009 (A/HRC/RES/12/16), the Council reaffirmed \u2018the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in particular the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the right to freedom of expression, (\u2026) and the intrinsically linked rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, peaceful assembly and association and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs\u2019. \u00b7 In Resolution 15/21 of 30 September 2010 (A/HRC/RES/15/21), the Council recognised that \u2018the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association are essential components of democracy, providing individuals with invaluable opportunities to, inter alia, express their political opinions, engage in literary and artistic pursuits and other cultural, economic and social activities, engage in religious observances or other beliefs, form and join trade unions and cooperatives, and elect leaders to represent their interests and hold them accountable\u2019. In the same resolution, the Human Rights Council also decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. \u00b7 In decision 17/120, the Council decided to convene, at its eighteenth session, a panel discussion on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests. During the panel, which took place on 13 September 2011, a majority of the delegations participating in the discussions stressed \u2018the primary responsibility of States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals, including women and the youth, taking part in peaceful assemblies\u2019. They added that \u2018guaranteeing human rights in the context of peaceful protests was at the essence of democratic participation and violence against peaceful protestors was an attempt against democracy which could threaten international peace and security\u2019. \u00b7 In Resolution 19/35 of 23 March 2012 (A/HRC/RES/19/35), the Council acknowledged \u2018that peaceful protests can occur in all societies\u2019 and recalled that \u2018States have the responsibility, including in the context of peaceful protests, to promote and protect human rights and to prevent human rights violations, in particular extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary arrests and detention, enforced disappearances, and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment\u2019, and called \u2018upon States to avoid the abuse of criminal and civil proceedings of threats of such acts at all times\u2019. It further requested the High Commissioner to prepare a thematic report on the issue. The report (A/HRC/22/28) was submitted to the Council at its March 2013 session and covers the work of the treaty bodies and special procedures in relation to peaceful protests. It also discusses the relevant national legislation, as well as measures and best practices of States that deal with holding of assemblies and the use of force. \u00b7 In Resolution 21/16 of 27 September 2012 (A/HRC/RES/21/16), the Council reiterated \u2018the important role of new information and communications technologies in enabling and facilitating the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of assembly and of association, and the importance for all States to promote and facilitate access to the Internet and international cooperation aimed at the development of media and information and communications facilities in all countries\u2019. \u00b7 Finally, in Resolution 22/10 of 21 March 2013 (A/HRC/RES/22/10), the Human Rights Council went at length on addressing the many human rights issues linked to the exercise of peaceful protests. In particular, it called upon States to \u2018promote a safe and enabling environment for individuals and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association, including by ensuring that their domestic legislation and procedures relating to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association are in conformity with their international human rights obligations and commitments\u2019. Relevant activities of special procedures 3. Peaceful protests have been addressed by several mandate holders in their recent activities and reports. The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association submitted his first thematic report (A/HCR/20/27) to the Council at its twentieth session in June 2012. The report highlights the best practices that protect and promote the rights to freedom of assembly and association. The Special Rapporteur\u2019s second report (A/HRC/23/39) was submitted to the Council at its twenty-third session in May 2013 and focused on funding of associations and holding of peaceful assemblies. 4. The issue of the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials in several situations of peaceful protests in the past years also prompted the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to elaborate on the legal norms applicable to the use of lethal force during demonstrations in its report submitted to the Council at its seventeenth session of May 2011 (A/HRC/17/28). Relevant activities of treaty bodies 5. The Human Rights Committee has elaborated on the meaning and content of several relevant provisions of the ICCPR, in particular Article 19 (freedom of expression), Article 21 (freedom of peacefully assembly), Article 22 (freedom of association ) and Article 25 (right to participate to the conduct of public affairs), through General Comments and jurisprudence. III. SEMINAR: PROGRAMME 6. Pursuant to Human Rights Council Resolution 22/10 of 21 March 2013 (A/HRC/RES/22/10), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will organise a seminar on effective measures and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests. This seminar will take place on 2 December 2013 in Geneva (Palais des Nations, Conference room XVI). 7. The Seminar will bring together States, representatives of relevant United Nations entities and representatives of civil society organisations, as well as academic institutions. Experts will be invited to share their views and experiences with participants. 8. Following an opening session, the seminar will be structured around three expert panels on the following themes: Session 1: Human rights law dimension of peaceful protest The first session will discuss the legal framework for the exercise of peaceful protest. International human rights law does not recognize per se a \u2018right to peaceful protest\u2019. Peaceful protests, however, involve the exercise of several rights, including the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (Article 21 ICCPR) and the right to freedom of association (Article 22 ICCPR). The right to freedom of expression (Article 19 ICCPR) and the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs (Article 25 ICCPR) are also relevant to peaceful protests. This is reflected in the resolution adopted on 21 March 2013 by the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests (A/HRC/RES/22/10). In this resolution, the Human Rights Council called upon \u2018States to promote a safe and enabling environment for individuals and groups to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association, including by ensuring that their domestic legislation and procedures relating to the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association are in conformity with their international human rights obligations and commitments\u2019 (para. 3). Session 2: Protests and participation in the conduct of public affairs The Human Rights Committee, in its General Comment n\u00b025 (1996), stated that enjoyment of the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs requires the full enjoyment and respect for the rights guaranteed in article 19 (freedom of expression), 21 (freedom of peaceful assembly) and 22 (freedom of association) of the ICCPR, including, inter alia, freedom to hold peaceful demonstrations and meetings (para. 25). The Human Rights Council in its Resolution of 21 March 2013 (A/HRC/RES/22/10) also stressed that \u2018peaceful protest should not be viewed as a threat\u2019, and therefore \u2018encouraged all States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful dialogue when dealing with peaceful protests and their causes\u2019. The exercise of peaceful protests raises specific challenges with regard to the participation of members of certain groups in the conduct of public affairs of a country (minorities, women or human rights defenders), in particular, but not only, when protests take place prior and during electoral times. As noted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in his first report to the General Assembly (A/68/299), \u2018electoral periods are a unique moment in the life of a nation to confirm, and even strengthen, democratic principles, such as non-discrimination, gender equality, pluralism of views and parity\u2019 and \u2018in effect, genuine elections cannot be achieved if the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are curtailed\u2019 (para. 56). Session 3: Management of peaceful assemblies Excessive use of force is a too common feature of past as well as recent examples of protest. The type of weapons, the methods of management of assemblies and the degree of force used in the context of protests have raised serious concerns with regard to the respect of the right to life. As noted by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in his 2011 report (A/HRC/17/28), \u2018recent events in the Arab World, and in other countries, have again illustrated how easily protests and demonstrations could end in large-scale bloodshed and tragedy. In many instances, this occurs where the police do not apply human rights standards\u2019. In its resolution 22/10 of 21 March 2013 (A/HRC/RES/22/10), the Human Rights Council, called upon States, \u2018as a matter of priority, to ensure that their domestic legislation and procedures are consistent with their international obligations and commitments in relation to the use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular applicable principles of law enforcement, such as the principles of necessity and proportionality, bearing in mind that lethal force may only be used to protect against an imminent threat to life and that it may not be used to disperse a gathering\u2019 (para. 8). It further called upon States \u2018to investigate any death or injury committed during protests, including those resulting from the discharge of firearms or the use of non-lethal weapons by law enforcement officials\u2019 (para. 9). Outcome: 9. OHCHR will prepare and publish a report on the outcome of the seminar, as requested by the Human Rights Council Resolution 22/10.

(The Holy Bible, New International Version, Deuteronomy chapter 18, verse 18). The prophet described in the above verse must have the following three characteristics: 1. He will be like Moses. 2. He will come from the brothers of the Israelites, i.e. the Ishmaelites. 3. God will put His words in the mouth of the prophet and he will declare what God commanded him. Let us see which prophet God was speaking of. 1. The prophet like Moses Some people feel that this prophecy refers to the prophet Jesus, on whom be peace. But, although Jesus (peace be upon him and all of God\u2019s prophets and messengers) was truly a prophet of God, he is not the prophet spoken of here. He was born miraculously, and finally God raised him up miraculously. On the other hand, Muhammad is more like Moses; both were born in a natural way and both died natural deaths. 2. From among the Ishmaelites Abraham had two sons, Ishmael and Isaac (Genesis, chapter 21). Ishmael became the grandfather of the Arab nation. And Isaac became the grandfather of Jewish nation. The prophet spoken of was to come not from among the Jews themselves, but from among their brothers, the Ishmaelites. Muhammad a descendant of Ishmael, is indeed that prophet. 3. God will put his words in his mouth \u2018Neither the content of the revelation, nor its form, were of Muhammad\u2019s devising. Both were given by the angel, and Muhammad\u2019s task was only to repeat what he heard.\u2019 (Word Religions from Ancient history to the Present, by Geoffrey Parrinder, p. 472). God sent the angel Gabriel to teach Muhammad the exact words that he should repeat to the people. The words are therefore not his own; they did not come from his own thoughts, but were put into his mouth by the angel. These are written down in the Qur\u2019an word for word, exactly as they came from God. Now that we know that prophet we must listen to him, for, according to the Bible, God says: \u2018I will punish anyone who refuses to obey him\u2019 (Good News Bible, Deut. 18:19). Jesus (on whom be peace) In the Glorious Qur'an The Qur\u2019an tells us many wonderful things about Jesus. As a result, believers in the Qur\u2019an love Jesus, honor him and believe in him. In fact, no Muslim can be a Muslim unless he or she believes in Jesus, on whom be peace. The Qur\u2019an says that Jesus was born of a virgin, that he spoke while he was still only a baby, that he healed the blind and the leper by God's leave and that he raised the dead by God's leave. What then is the significance of these miracles? First, the virgin birth. God demonstrates His power to create in every way. God created everyone we know from a man and a woman. But how about Adam, on whom be peace? God created him from neither a man nor a woman. And Eve from only a man, without a woman. And finally, to complete the picture, God created Jesus from a woman, without a man. What about the other miracles? These were to show that Jesus was not acting on his own behalf, but that he was backed by God. The Qur\u2019an specifies that these miracles were performed by God's leave. This may be compared to the Book of Acts in the Bible, chapter 2, verse 22, where it says that the miracles were done by God to show that he approved of Jesus. Also, note that Jesus himself is recorded in the Gospel of John to have said: \u2018I can do nothing of my own authority' (5:30). The miracles, therefore, were done not by his own authority, but by God's authority. What did Jesus teach? The Qur'an tells us that Jesus came to teach the same basic message which was taught by previous prophets from God \u2013 that we must shun every false god and worship only the One True God. Jesus taught that he is the servant and messenger of the One True God, the God of Abraham. These Qur'anic teachings can be compared with the Bible (Mark 10:18; Matthew 26:39; John 14:28, 17:3, and 20:17) where Jesus teaches that the one he worshipped is the only true God. See also Matthew 12:18; Acts 3:13, and 4:27 where we find that his disciples knew him as \u2018Servant of God\u2019. The Qur\u2019an tells us that some of the Israelites rejected Jesus, and conspired to kill him, but God rescued Jesus and raised him to Himself. God will cause Jesus to descend again, at which time Jesus will confirm his true teachings and everyone will believe in him as he is and as the Qur'an teaches about him. Jesus is the Messiah. He is a word from God, and a spirit from Him. He is honored in this world and in the hereafter, and he is one of those brought nearest to God. Jesus was a man who spoke the truth which he heard from God. This can be compared with the Gospel According John where Jesus says to the Israelites: \u2018You are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God\u2019 (John 8:40).

For I have never thought of my coming into Islam as having one critical turning point. When did I first question Catholicism? When did I first want to become a Muslim? The answers to these questions and many others require more thought than I could have ever imagined. To really answer these questions I have to start at the very beginning so that you understand the point to where I got in my life that led me to finally accept the truth of Islam. I became a Muslim at the age of 67, and I thank God that He has blessed me to become a believer in Islam. \u201cThose whom Allah (in His plan) wills to guide,- He opens their breast to Islam; those whom He wills to leave straying,- He makes their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus does Allah (heap)the penalty on those who refuse to believe.\u201d (Quran 6: 125) I was raised in a strict Roman Catholic home, the middle daughter of three children. My father worked hard and long every day. He would leave early in the morning each day and would return late at night. All of this so that my mother could stay home and take care of my sisters and me. One very sad and unfortunate day my mother told us that my father had been in a car accident. He passed away suddenly and our whole world turned upside down. With all the changes that were taking place, my mother told us that she would now have to go back to work. My mother, who had once been a nurse, was now forced to work to support us. She found a job in the local hospital, many times working two shifts. But with this newfound responsibility, my mother was no longer able to oversee our upbringing. And although she sent us to Catholic school, her job kept her from keeping a watchful eye on her daughters. So, with much time to pass and spend, I found myself spending time with my friends at the local cafes. It was there that I met a very nice Musliman man who later became my husband. My mother did not know that I was spending time with this man. In fact, when I told her that I was in love and wanted to get married, she warned that we were from different backgrounds and that we would eventually have problems. She stated that if there were ever children in our future, problems over religion would undoubtedly develop. At twenty years old, I could not imagine that we would have any problems in our marriage. I was so in love and felt so happy that someone would be taking care of me. My husband was not a very religious man at that time, and deep down I felt that I would be able to get him to convert to Catholicism. As for us not having the same ethnic background, I considered myself more open-minded and was excited to be embracing a new culture. Everything seemed to be going along so perfectly for the next several years. We were happy and not once did culture or religion ever cause us any problems. God blessed us with a beautiful son and then several years later with a beautiful daughter. Still, we went along with our lives and I even began taking my children to church with me. My husband never prevented me from attending weekly Sunday mass. However, after a few times of my taking our children to church, that is when he spoke to me about his not wanting the children to attend church. Frankly, I was angry and upset. \u201cBut why not,\u201d I objected. \u201cAny religion is better than none,\u201d I argued. I really could not understand the harm in taking them to church. Up until this point, we had never even discussed religion. In fact, I had never even questioned that there could even be a different religion than Catholicism. I was born a Catholic and thought that Catholicism was the right religion. For explanations that I can\u2019t even put a finger on, it seemed like from this day on, so many problems were now evident. We argued all the time\u2014 about everything and everyone. Now, little things became a big deal. Religion became an arguing point between us. The differences in our cultures became something to argue about. We argued about in-laws and most unfortunately, we argued on the upbringing of our children. Everything that my mother warned us about was now coming true. The only peace and harmony that was now between us was the wisdom, sincerity, concern and love my husband\u2019s father, my father-in-law, had for our marriage. My father-in-law loved his son and grandchildren, yet also genuinely loved me as a daughter. He was a very religious and devout Muslim and was a very wise man. At that time, because I was not surrounded with Islam, my father-in law was the first introduction into Islam I had. He prayed every prayer, fasted during the month of Ramadan, and was very generous to the poor. I could feel his connection to God. In fact, my father-in-law was so kind to the needy that every day after coming home from the Zuhr prayer at the mosque, he would invite any needy person home to eat lunch with. This was every single day. Up until his death at the age of 95, relatives remembered that he had continued with this habit. My father-in-law did not like the arguing between my husband and me and counseled us to find a solution before the children suffered as a result of our fighting. He tried desperately to help us find a solution. He warned his son to allow me room to practice my religion, but it was no longer about religion anymore. I felt frustrated and desired to take a break. When I asked my husband for a separation, he agreed that perhaps it was the best thing for our marriage. You know the saying, \u201cAbsence makes the heart grow fonder.\u201d Well, not in our case. In fact, the absence made our hearts grow further apart. After the separation, we both wanted a permanent separation and agreed on a divorce. Although I desperately wanted my children to live with me, we both felt that it would be better for the children to be raised by their father. He was in a much better position, financially, to raise them and give them many comforts; something I was not prepared to give. How I longed for them every night. I moved back with my mother and continued seeing my children every weekend. My ex-husband would drop off our children on Friday afternoons and pick them up early Sunday mornings. Although this arrangement hurt, it was better than nothing. Each night before going to bed, I would read from the Bible. When my children were visiting me, I would read them a passage regardless of whether my children understood or not. After reading a passage, one night I would seek help from Jesus, the next night from the angels, the next night from the different saints, the next night from the Virgin Mary. But one night we had no one else to ask, I had run out of Saints. So I said \u2018 now we\u2019re going to ask God\u2019. My son said \u2018Okay, now who is God?\u2019 I said \u2018He\u2019s the one who created you, who created me. He is forever our neighbor\u2019. So he was pondering, he was thinking about those words. To my explanation, I rubbed my cross again. I said \u2018now thank God\u2019. He looked at the cross and said \u2018Mamma, who is this?\u2019 I said \u2018This is God. He\u2019s the son of God\u2019. He said \u2018You just told me a minute ago that God is forever. How come this one is dead?\u2019 I never, never in my whole life realized that fact. He asked me where does this god come from? And I said, he came from the womb of Mary, of the Virgin Mary. He said \u2018Oh, so he was born sometime before\u2019. I said \u2018well, yes\u2019. But then he said \u2018But you told me that he\u2019s forever. He never dies and he\u2019s never born. My son, who was now about eight, asked me directly, \u201cMama, why don\u2019t you just ask God for help?\u201c I was surprised and stunned and remember feeling a bit shocked that he would question my religion. I told him that I also ask God. Little did I know that this son of mine would grow up to be a constant thorn in my side, always reminding me about the need to worship the One, True God. Thank God. I ended up remarring a few years later and relocated to Australia with my new husband. My ex-husband, who had also remarried, moved his family to Saudi Arabia. I loved to see my children but eventually it was in Italy where I started a new family and became the mother to three more daughters. Still, every single night I would pray, \u201cIn the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\u201c The years passed quickly and busily. I was so excited one summer; my son and daughter would be coming to visit me. So many things raced through my mind. Would they be happy to see me after such a long absensce? What would we talk about? I prayed for help. All of my fears evaporated the first time I laid eyes on my children at the airport. There was an instant bond between mother and children and it was if little time had elasped. My son was the more vocal of the two. He made sure to remind me that they do not eat pork, nor could they eat foods that contained alcohol. I told him that I remember that about his religion. I also told him that I also do not eat pork, nor drank alcohol, a habit that remained from the time I was married to his father. As for the wine, well, I would make sure to stop cooking with it while they were home with me. We had a beautiful summer, getting to know each other, them getting to know their new sisters, pickinicking, going on outings, swimming. I did not want it to end. But I knew that they had their life back in Saudi Arabia and they needed to get back. I asked my daughter the dreaded question of how her step-mother treated her, and I honestly felt happiness when she said she was treated like a daughter. My children visited me together two more times after that summer. When my son turned 21, he came to live with me for 6 months. We would argue religion\u2014boy, would we argue religion! My son and I are somewhat similar in personality, but we do have our differences \u2013 and very obvious ones at that! Whilst I\u2019m very hot tempered in disputes, my son is a lot cooler, so he tends to maintain a sense of calm while I\u2019m borderline crazy! Despite this clash, I believe it works in our favor in that we can find balance within our discussion. We\u2019re very much alike in that we are loving, generous and helpful people. What I admire most about my son is his dedication to almost everything he does. He is a sweet, gentle person, but has strong ethics and aims to achieve whatever he puts his mind to, which I respect a lot. I admire his ability to keep a level head in the most stressful of situations. He\u2019s very logical and won\u2019t dwell too long over a problem. He just attempts to find solutions and neutralize situations as much as possible. I continued to pray that my son would find it in his heart to convert to Catholicism. I so badly wished that he would become a priest\u2014I felt he would make a fine preacher. He was a good boy, and God-fearing at that. Good qualification for the Priesthood. When I once told him that he would make a wonderful priest, my son smiled and replied that it would be more likely that his mother would become a Muslim rather than he become a Catholic priest. After 6 months, though, my son expressed desire to leave for the United States. He eventually settled in America and made a home in Miami, Florida. Meanwhile, I became a widow with one teenager daughter left in the house. My son really wanted for me to join him in America, so I left to the States with my 17-year-old daughter. We very much liked it in America and my daughter quickly started to make a life for herself. Nothing had changed for my son and me\u2014we continued talking about Catholicism and Islam and neither one of us would \u2018give up\u2018. Sometimes, when the subject of the Trinity came up and I could not find any answers or rebuttal to him, I would just put up my hand and walk away. I would get very angry for what I saw was his attacking my religion. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like everyone else,\u201c I asked. \u201cOther Muslims accept me and do not try to convert me.\u201c \u201cI\u2019m not like everyone else,\u201c he answered. \u201cI love you. I am your son and I want you to go to Paradise.\u201c I told him that I am going to Paradise\u2014I am a good, honest woman, who doesn\u2019t lie, steal, or cheat.\u201c My son answered, \u201cThese things are neccessary and helpful in this wordly life, however in the Quran it is stated many times that Allah does not forgive Shirk (Polytheism). The Quran says that the ONLY sin that God will not forgive is associating partners with Him, but He forgives anything else to whom He wills.\u201d He begged me to read and learn and discover Islam. Books were brought so that I might open my mind. I refused. Born a Catholic, I will die a Catholic. For the next 10 years, I remained living near my son, his wife, and family. I desired, though, to also spend some time with my daughter, who was still living in Saudi Arabia. It wasn\u2019t easy to get a visa. My son joked that if I just accepted Islam, that would be the visa to enter Saudi Arabia; for I would then be able to get an Umrah visa. I told him sternly that I wasn\u2019t a Muslim. After much hard work and a few connections, I was given a visitor\u2018s visa to visit my daughter, who was now the mother of three children. Before leaving, my son held me in a bear hug, and told me how much he loved me, how badly he wanted Paradise for me. He then went on to say how he had everything he had wanted in this life, except for a Mother who was a Muslim. He told me that he prayed to God (Allah) every single day that He (SWT) would change my heart to accept Islam. I told him that that would never happen. 1. I visited my daughter in Saudi Arabia and fell in love with the country, the weather, and the people. I didn\u2019t want to leave after the 6 months so I requested an extension. I would hear the athan (call to prayer) 5 times a day and would see the faithful ones close their shops and walk off to prayer. Although that was very touching, I continued reading from my Bible every morning and evening and would constantly say the rosary. Not once did my daughter or any other Muslim person ever speak to me about Islam or try to get me to convert. They respected me and allowed me to practice my religion. My son was coming to Saudi Arabia to visit me. I was so happy\u2014I had missed him so. No sooner did he come was he again after me, talking religion and the Oneness of God. I was angry. I told him that I have been in Saudi Arabia for over one year and not once has anyone ever spoken about religion to me. And he, on his second night here, is so quick to begin the preaching. He apologized and again told me how much he wanted me to accept Islam. I again told him that I would never leave Christianity. He asked me about the Trinity and how could I believe in something that just did not make any logical sense. He reminded me that even I had questions about this. I told him that everything does not have to make sense\u2014you just have to have faith. He seemed like he accepted this answer and I was happy that I finally won a discussion on religion. My son then told me to explain the miracle of Jesus to him. Aha, I thought! I am finally getting somewhere. I explained the miracle birth of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Jesus dying for our sins, God breathing His Spirit in him, Jesus as God, Jesus as the Son of God. He was quiet the entire time I was talking\u2014no rebuttal\u2014my son, quiet? He then quietly asked, \u201cMamma, if Jesus died for our sins on a Friday, and then as you say, he was resurrected three days later on a Sunday, then who ruled the world for those three days? Mamma, explain that to me?\u201d I thought about the logic to this question and at that moment, I knew that it did not make any sense. I said, \u201cJesus was the son of God. Jesus and God are one and the same. My son replied, \u201cCows have calves; little cows. Cats have kittens; little cats. Humans have children; little humans. When God has a son, what is he? A little God? If so, then do you have two Gods?\u201d Then he asked, \u201cMama, can you ever become a God?\u201d What a ridiculous question I told him. Humans can never be a God. (Now, I was really getting angry) He then asked, \u201cWas Jesus a human being?\u201d I replied, \u201cYes.\u201d He then said \u201cTherefore, he could never be God.\u201d The claim that God became man is also an absurdity. It is not befitting of God to take on human characteristics because it means that the Creator has become His creation. However, the creation is a product of the creative act of the Creator. If the Creator became His creation, it would mean that the Creator created Himself, which is an obvious absurdity. To be created, He would first have to not exist, and, if He did not exist, how could He then create? Furthermore, if He were created, it would mean that He had a beginning, which also contradicts His being eternal. By definition creation is in need of a creator. For created beings to exist they must have a creator to bring them into existence.God cannot need a creator because God is the Creator. Thus, there is an obvious contradiction in terms. The claim that God became His creation implies that He would need a creator, which is a ludicrous concept. It contradicts the fundamental concept of God being uncreated, needing no creator and being the Creator. Knowing I did not have an answer to him, I replied, \u201cLet me think about the answer.\u201d That evening, I thought long and hard about what my son said. The idea that Jesus as the son of God did not make sense to me anymore. I also could not accept the fact as Jesus and God being one in the same. Before going to sleep that night, my son told me to pray to God before going to sleep and ask Him alone to guide me to the right path. I promised my son that I would sincerely supplicate to God for the anwer. I went to my room and read from the book my son had given me. Next, I opened the Holy Quran and began to read. It was if something had been lifted from my heart. I felt different. I saw the truth in Islam. What had I been fighting against all these years? That night I prayed to God alone\u2014not to Jesus, not to Mary, not to the angels or saints or holy spirit. Just to God I cried and asked for guidance. I prayed that if Islam was the right choice to please change my heart and mind. I went to sleep and the next morning I woke up and announced to my son that I was ready to accept Islam. He was astonished. We both began to cry. My daughter and granddaughter were called out and watched as I submitted, \u201cThere is no God worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) is His Messenger and Last Prophet.\u201c I felt a changed woman. I was happy, as if someone had lifted a veil of darkness from my heart. Everyone who knew me couldn\u2019t believe that I had converted. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even believe it! But Islam felt so right, so peaceful, so serene! After my son left back to the states, I learned how to recite Surah-al-Fatiha in Arabic and have since learned how to perform the prayers. I continued with life as before; except now I am a Muslim. I always loved attending family gatherings with my daughter, and social events as well. I would attend family and friends weddings, henna parties, baby showers (aqiqah) and the gatherings when someone died. About 6 months after I had converted to Islam, I was at a funeral gathering that really touched my heart and reinforced what a beautiful religion Islam is. A young boy had died from a sickness. As my daughter was getting ready to leave for the condolences, I asked her if she knew the family well. She answered that she did not. \u201cThen why go?\u201c I asked. \u201cBecause the family is grieving, and it is my duty in Islam to go and perhaps offer any support that I can.\u201c I decided to dress and go with her. I went along with my daughter to pay condolences to the boy\u2019s family and was overwhelmed at the number of people in attendance. I was surprised and touched that so many people came to give the family support. All I could think of as I saw the family grieving was what a beautiful religion Islam was that so many people felt it their responsibility to give their support. And that one event, where Muslims were showing an outpoor of sympathy is another moment that proved the beauty of Islam. I have been a Muslim for three years now, Alhamdullilah. Since that time, I have performed Umrah twice with my son and daughter. My son, daughter and I visited the Kabaah and the Holy Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Madinah. I just celebrated my 70th birthday Alhumdullilah. Sometimes I think back to all the hardship and heartache that I must have caused my son, but my son was extremelly happy to serve me by also being a means to bring me to Islam. He then said, that the Prophet (SAW) told a person, \u201c Paradise lies under the feet of mothers\". The meaning of the Hadith is that you should serve your mother and take good care of her. It is for sure by being at my feet that there was paradise for both of us. I also wonder if my daughter would have applied a little pressure on me, I might have become a Muslim sooner. But my son reminded me that Allah is the best of planners. And it is only He (SWT) that can give a person Hidaya (Guidance). \u201c Indeed it is not such that you can guide whomever you love, but Allah guides whomever He wills. \u201c (Quran 28:56). The best thing that Allah had honored me is by guiding me to the path of Islam and making me a Muslim, and Insha Allah enter together with my son in Paradise. \u201c. Ameen PAGE 8"

He placed this awareness deep in their hearts as a natural disposition that has not changed since human beings were first created. Furthermore, He reinforced this natural disposition with the signs that he placed in Creation that testify to His existence. However, since it is not possible for human beings to have a detailed knowledge of God except through revelation from Himself, God sent His Messengers to teach the people about their Creator Who they must worship. These Messengers also brought with them the details of how to worship Allah, because such details cannot be known except by way of revelation. These two fundamentals were the most important things that the Messengers of all the divine revelations brought with them from God. On this basis, all the divine revelations have had the same lofty objectives, which are: 1. To affirm the Oneness of Allah - the praised and glorified Creator \u2013 in His essence and His attributes. 2. To affirm that Allah alone should be worshipped and that no other being should be worshipped along with Him or instead of Him. 3. To safeguard human welfare and oppose corruption and evil. Thus, everything that safeguards faith, life, reason, wealth and lineage are part of this human welfare that religion protects. On the other hand, anything that endangers these five universal needs is a form of corruption that religion opposes and prohibits. 4. To invite the people to the highest level of virtue, moral values, and noble customs. The ultimate goal of every Divine Message has always been the same: to guide the people to Allah, to make them aware of Him, and to have them worship Him alone. Each Divine Message came to strengthen this meaning, and the following words were repeated on the tongues of all the Messengers: \u201cWorship Allah, you have no god other than Him.\u201d This message was conveyed to humanity by prophets and messengers which God sent to every nation. All of these messengers came with this same message, the message of Islam. All the Divine Messages came to bring the life of the people into willing submission to Allah. For this reason, they all share the name of Islam, which means submission in Arabic. Islam, in this sense, was the religion of all the Prophets, but why does one see different variations of the religion of God if they all emanated from the same source? The answer is twofold. The first reason is that as a result of the passage of time, and due to the fact that previous religions were not under the Divine protection of God, they underwent much change and variation. As a result, we see that the fundamental truths which were brought by all messengers now differ from one religion to another, the most apparent being the strict tenet of the belief and worship of God and God alone. The second reason for this variation is that God, in His infinite Wisdom and eternal Will, decreed that all the divine missions prior to the final message of Islam brought by Muhammad, may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him, be limited to a specific time frame. As a result, their laws and methodologies dealt with the specific conditions of the people whom they had been sent to address. Humanity has passed through numerous periods of guidance, misguidance, integrity, and deviation, from the most primitive age to the heights of civilization. Divine guidance accompanied humanity through all of this, always providing the appropriate solutions and remedies. This was the essence of the disparity that existed between the different religions. This disagreement never went beyond the particulars of the Divine Law. Each manifestation of the Law addressed the particular problems of the people it was meant for. However, the areas of agreement were significant and many, such as fundamentals of faith; the basic principles and objectives of the Divine Law, such as protecting faith, life, reason, wealth, and lineage and establishing justice in the land; and certain fundamental prohibitions, some of the most important of these being idolatry, fornication, murder, theft, and giving false witness. Moreover, they also agreed upon moral virtues like honesty, justice, charity, kindness, chastity, righteousness, and mercy. These principles as well as others are permanent and lasting; they are the essence of all the Divine Messages and bind them all together. But where does the message of Muhammad fit in with the previous messages revealed by God? A brief history of the prophets might clear this point. The first human, Adam, followed Islam, in that he directed worship to God alone and none else and abided by His commandments. But through the passage of time and the dispersal of humanity throughout the earth, people strayed from this message and began directing worship to others instead of or along with God. Some took to worshipping the pious who passed away amongst them, while others took to worshipping spirits and forces of nature. It was then that God started to send messengers to humanity steering them back to the worship of God Alone, which accorded to their true nature, and warning them of the grave consequences of directing any type of worship to others besides Him. The first of these messengers was Noah, who was sent to preach this message of Islam to his people, after they had started to direct worship to their pious forefathers along with God. Noah called his people to leave the worship of their idols, and ordered them to return to the worship of God Alone. Some of them followed the teachings of Noah, while the majority disbelieved in him. Those who followed Noah were followers of Islam, or Muslims, while those that did not, remained in their disbelief and were seized with a punishment for doing so. After Noah, God sent messengers to every nation who had strayed from the Truth, to steer them back to it. This Truth was the same throughout time: to reject all objects of worship and to direct all worship without exception to God and none else, the Creator and Lord of all, and to abide by His commandments. But as we mentioned before, because each nation differed in regards to their way of life, language, and culture, specific messengers were sent to specific nations for a specific time period. God sent messengers to all nations, and to the Kingdom of Babylon He sent Abraham \u2013 one of the earliest and greatest prophets \u2013 who called his people to reject the worship of the idols to which they were devoted. He called them to Islam, but they rejected him and even tried to kill him. God put Abraham through many tests, and he proved true to all of them. For his many sacrifices, God proclaimed that he would raise amongst his progeny a great nation and choose prophets from amongst them. Whenever people from his progeny started to stray away from the Truth, which was to worship none but God alone and to obey His commandments, God sent them another messenger steering them back to it. Consequently, we see that many prophets were sent amongst the progeny of Abraham, such as his two sons Isaac and Ishmael, along with Jacob (Israel), Joseph, David, Solomon, Moses, and of course, Jesus, to mention a few, may the Peace and Blessings of God be upon them all. Each prophet was sent to the Children of Israel (the Jews) when they went astray from the true religion of God, and it became obligatory upon them to follow the messenger which was sent to them and obey their commandments. All of the messengers came with the same message, to reject worship of all other beings except God Alone and to obey His commandments. Some disbelieved in the prophets, while others believed. Those that believed were followers of Islam, or Muslims. From amongst the messengers was Muhammad, from the progeny of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, may the Peace and Blessings of God be upon him, who was sent as a messenger in succession to Jesus. Muhammad (pbuh) preached the same message of Islam as the previous prophets and messengers \u2013 to direct all worship to God Alone and none else and to obey His commandments \u2013 in which the followers of the previous prophets went astray. So as we see, the Prophet Muhammad was not the founder of a new religion, as many people mistakenly think, but he was sent as the Final Prophet of Islam. By revealing His final message to Muhammad, which is an eternal and universal message for all of mankind, God finally fulfilled the covenant that He made with Abraham. Just as it was incumbent upon the those who were alive to follow the message of the last of the succession of Prophets which was sent to them, it becomes incumbent upon all of humanity to follow the message of Muhammad (pbuh). God promised that this message would remain unchanged and fit for all times and places. Suffice it to say that the way of Islam is the same as the way of the prophet Abraham, because both the Bible and the Quran portray Abraham as a towering example of someone who submitted himself completely to God and directed worship to Him alone and none else, and without any intermediaries. Once this is realized, it should be clear that Islam has the most continuous and universal message of any religion, because all prophets and messengers were \u201cMuslims\u201d, i.e. those who submitted to God\u2019s will, and they preached \u201cIslam\u201d, i.e. submission to the will of Almighty God by worshipping Him Alone and obeying His commandments. So we see that those who call themselves Muslims today do not follow a new religion; rather they follow the religion and message of all prophets and messengers which were sent to humanity by God\u2019s command, also known as Islam. The word \u201cIslam\u201d is an Arabic word which literally means \u201csubmission to God\u201d, and Muslims are those who willfully submit to and actively obey God, living in accordance with His message.

We praise Him, seek for His assistance and forgiveness and we seek refuge with Him from evils of our souls and our misdeeds. No one can mislead whosoever Allah guides and none can guide whosoever Allah causes to go astray. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone. He has no partner. I also testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. In this work I collected 40 common Questions and answering about Islam from different sources. It can guide you to understanding Islam and find answering to your Questions . it contents many subjects About Islam like : Allah, Muslims, prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) , Jesus , pillars of Islam , Jihad, polygamy women ..ect I seek ALLAH to guide us to the straightway, the way of those, on whom ALLAH has Bestowed grace . 1-What is Islam? The word \"Islam\" means peace and submission. Peace means to be at peace with yourself and your surroundings and submission means submission to the will of God. A broader meaning of the word \"Islam\" is to achieve peace by submitting to the will of God. This is a unique religion with a name which signifies a moral attitude and a way of life. Judaism takes its name from the tribe of Juda, Christianity from Jesus Christ, Buddhism from Goutam Buddha and Hinduism from Indus River. However, Muslims derive their identity from the message of Islam, rather than the person of Muhammed (Peace be upon him), thus should not be called \"Muhammadans\". 2- Who is Allah? Allah is the Arabic word for \"one God\". Allah is not God of Muslims only. He is God of all creations, because He is their Creator and Sustainer. 3-Does Allah look like us? \u00a0No, Allah is perfect. He is not like any of His creations. A Muslim does not say a single thing about Allah other than what Allah says about Himself. Allah is Perfect and Unique. 4-What is the Kabah? The Kabah is the place of worship, which God commanded Abraham and Ishmael to build over four thousand years ago. The building was constructed of stone on what many believe was the original site of a sanctuary established by Adam. God commanded Abraham to summon all mankind to visit this place, and when pilgrims go there today they say 'At Thy service, O Lord', in response to Abraham's summons. 5- Who is a Muslim? The word \"Muslim\" means one who submits to the will of God. This is done by declaring that \"there is no god except one God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" In a broader sense, anyone who willingly submits to the will of God is a Muslim. Thus, all the prophets preceding the prophet Muhammad are considered Muslims. The Quran specifically mentions Abraham who lived long before Moses and Christ that, \"he was not a Jew or a Christian but a Muslim,\" because, he had submitted to the will of God. Thus there are Muslims who are not submitting at all to the will of God and there are Muslims who are doing their best to live an Islamic life. One cannot judge Islam by looking at those individuals who have a Muslim name but in their actions, they are not living or behaving as Muslims. The extent of being a Muslim can be according to the degree to which one is submitting to the will of God, in his beliefs and his actions. 6- Who was Muhammad? (Peace be upon him) In brief, Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was born in a noble tribe of Mecca in Arabia in the year 570 AD. His ancestry goes back to Prophet Ishmael (Peace be upon him), son of Prophet Abraham (Peace be upon him). His father died before his birth and his mother died when he was six. He did not attend a formal school since he was raised first by a nurse as it was the custom those days, and then by his grandfather and uncle. As a young man, he was known as a righteous person who used to meditate in a cave. At age 40, he was given the prophethood when the angel, Gabriel, appeared in the cave. Subsequently, the revelations came over 23 years and were compiled in the form of a book called the Quran which Muslims consider as the final and the last word of God. The Quran has been preserved, unchanged, in its original form and confirms the truth in the Torah, the psalms and the Gospel. (1) 7-How did Muhammad (peace be upon him) become a prophet and a messenger of God? At the age of 40, while engaged in a meditative retreat, Muhammad (peace be upon him) received his first revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel. This revelation, which continued for twenty-three years, is known as the Quran. As soon as he began to recite the words he heard from Gabriel, and to preach the truth that God had revealed to him, he and his small group of followers suffered bitter persecution, which grew so fierce that in the year 622 God gave them the command to emigrate. This event, the Hijrah, 'migration', in which they left Makkah for the city of Madinah some 260 miles to the north, marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. After several years, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his followers were able to return to Makkah, where they forgave their enemies and established Islam definitively. Before the Prophet (peace be upon him) died at the age of 63, the greater part of Arabia was Muslim, and within a century of his death Islam had spread to Spain in the West and as Far East as China. 8- Do Muslims worship Muhammad? (Peace be upon him) No. Muslims do not worship Muhammad (Peace be upon him) or any other prophets. Muslims believe in all prophets including Adam, Noah, Abraham, David, Solomon, Moses and Jesus. Muslims believe that Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was the last of the prophets. They believe that God alone is to be worshiped, not any human being. ___________________________ 1-Khan,The personality of Allah\u2019s last messenger , p (17-34) 9-What is the Quran? The Quran is a record of the exact words revealed by God through the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). It was memorized by Muhammad (peace be upon him) and then dictated to his companions, and written down by scribes, who crosschecked it during his lifetime. Not one word of its 114 Surahs, has been changed over the centuries, so that the Quran is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) fourteen centuries ago. 10-What is the Quran about? The Quran, the last revealed Word of God, is the prime source of every Muslim's faith and practice. It deals with all the subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures. At the same time, it provides guidelines for a just society, proper human conduct and an equitable economic system . 11-Are there any other sacred sources? Yes, the Sunnah, the practice and example of the Prophet (peace be upon him), is the second authority for Muslims. A Hadith is a reliably transmitted report of what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, did, or approved. Belief in the Sunnah is part of the Islamic faith. Examples of the Prophet's sayings The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'God has no mercy on one who has no mercy for others.' 'None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.' 'Powerful is not he who knocks the other down, indeed powerful is he who controls himself in a fit of anger.' (From the Hadith collections of Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi and Baihaqi.) 12-How do we know Islam is the truth? 1- It is the only religion that holds Allah as One, Unique, and Perfect. 2- It is the only religion that believes in the sole worship of Allah, not Jesus, not an idol, and not an angel, only Allah. 3- The Quran does not contain contradictions. 4- The Quran contains scientific facts, which are 1300 years ahead of their time. The Quran, while revealed 1400 years ago contains scientific facts, which are only now being discovered. It is not in contradiction to science. 5- Allah has challenged the world to produce the like of the Quran. And He says they won't be able to. 6- Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the most influential man in history. In the book \"The 100 most influential men in History\", written by non-Muslim, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was #1. Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was #3. It should be noted that even the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by Allah. 13-Does Islam tolerate other beliefs? The Qur\u2019an says: Allah does not forbid you with regards to those who do not fight you for [your] faith nor drive you out\u00a0of your homes, from dealing kindly and justly with them; for Allah loves those who are just. (Qur\u2019an,\u00a060:8) There is no compulsion in religion. (2:214) It is one of the functions of Islamic law to protect the privileged status of minorities, and this is why non-Muslim places of worship have flourished all over the Islamic world. History provides many examples of Muslim tolerance towards other faiths. For example, when the caliph Omar entered Jerusalem in the year 634, he granted amnesty to all and sanctioned freedom of worship to all religious communities in the city. Another example is Muslims who ruled the Spain had such tolerance of other beliefs that the Golden Age of Jewish Civilization flourished under the Muslim rule. Not only that, Islamic law permits non-Muslim minorities to set up their own courts thus allowing them the autonomy to be judged according to their family law. 14-Do Islam and Christianity have different origins? Together with Judaism, they go back to the prophet and patriarch Abraham, and their three prophets are directly descended from his sons-Muhammad (peace be upon him) from the eldest, Ishmael, and Moses and Jesus, from Isaac. Abraham established the settlement, which today is the city of Makkah, and built the Kabah towards which all Muslims turn when they pray. 15. What do Muslims think of Jesus? (Peace be upon him) Muslims think highly of Jesus (peace be upon him) and his worthy mother, Mary. The Quran tells us that Jesus was born of a miraculous birth without a father. \"Lo! The likeness of Jesus with Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then He said unto him: Be and he is\" (Quran 3.59). He was given many miracles as a prophet. These include speaking soon after his birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, making a bird out of clay and most importantly, the message he was carrying. These miracles were given to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified but was raised into Heaven. (Quran, Chapter Maryam) 16-\"How can you believe in God, when you can't see, hear, touch, smell, taste or even imagine what He is?\" We know from the teachings of Muhammad, peace be upon him, that no one has ever actually seen God - at least not in this lifetime. Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize that all of this universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Something had to design it all and then put it into motion. That is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something that we can understand. We don't have to see an artist to recognize a painting, correct? So, if we see paintings without seeing artists painting them, in the same way, we can believe that Allah created everything without having to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.).(1) 17- What are the pillars of Islam? There are five major pillars of Islam which are the articles of faith. These pillars are 1) the belief (Iman) in one God and that Muhammad (P) is His messenger, 2) prayer (Salat) which are prescribed five times a day, 3) fasting (Siyam) which is required in the month of Ramadan, 4) charity (Zakat) which is the poor-due on the wealth of the rich and 5) hajj which is the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if one can afford it physically and financially. All the pillars should be of equal height and strength in a building in order to give the building its due shape and proportions. It is not possible that one would do hajj without observing fasting or without practicing regular prayers. Now think of a building which has pillars only. It would not be called a building. In order to make it a building, it has to have a roof, it has to have walls, it has to have doors and windows. These things in Islam are the moral codes of Islam such as honesty, truthfulness, steadfastness and many other human moral qualities. Thus in order to be a Muslim, one should not only be practicing the pillars of Islam but should also have the highest possible attribute for being a good human being. Only then the building is completed and looks beautiful. 18- What is the purpose of worship in Islam? The purpose of worship in Islam is to be God conscious. Thus the worship, whether it is prayer, fasting, or charity, is a means to achieve God consciousness so that when one becomes conscious of God, in thought and in action, he is in a better position to receive His bounties both in this world and the hereafter. 19- Do Muslims believe in the hereafter? God is Just and manifest His justice, He established the system of accountability. Those who do good will be rewarded and those who do wrong will be punished accordingly. Thus, He created Heaven and Hell and there are admission criteria for both. Muslims believe that the present life is a temporary one. It is a test and if we pass the test, we will be given a life of permanent pleasure in the company of good people in Heaven. 20- Will the good actions of the non-believers be wasted? No. The Quran clearly says that, \"anyone who has an atom's worth of goodness will see it and anyone who has done an atom's worth of evil will also see it\" (Quran 99:7- 8). By that it is meant that those who are non- believers but have done good will be rewarded in this world for their good deed. On the other hand, those who do good if they are Muslims, they will be rewarded not only in this world but also in the world hereafter. However, the final Judgment is up to God himself. (Quran 2:62) ___________________________ 1-www:knowingallah.com 21- What is the dress code for Muslims? Islam emphasizes modesty. No person should be perceived as a sex object. There are certain guidelines both for men and women that their dress should neither be too thin nor too tight to reveal body forms. For men, they must at least cover the area from the knee to navel and for women, their dress should cover all areas except the hands and face. 22- What are the dietary prohibitions in Islam? Muslims are told in the Quran not to eat pork or pork products, meat of the animals who died before being slaughtered or the carnivorous animals (as they eat dead animals), nor drink blood or intoxicants such as wine or use any illicit drugs. 23- What is Jihad? The word \"Jihad\" means struggle, or to be specific, striving in the cause of God. Any struggle done in day-to-day life to please God can be considered Jihad. One of the highest levels of Jihad is to stand up to a tyrant and speak a word of truth. Control of the self from wrong doings is also a great Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is to take up arms in defense of Islam or a Muslim country when Islam is attacked. This kind of Jihad has to be declared by the religious leadership or by a Muslim head of state who is following the Quran and Sunnah. 24- What is the Islamic Year? The Islamic year started from the migration (Hijra) of Prophet Muhammad (P) from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. It is a lunar year of 354 days. The first month is called Muharram. 1996 AD is in Islamic year 1416 AH. 25- What are the major Islamic festivals? Idul Fitre, marks the end of fasting in the month of Ramadan and is celebrated with public prayers, feasts and exchange of gifts. Idul Adha marks the end of the Hajj or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. After the public prayers, those who can afford, sacrifice a lamb or a goat to signify Prophet Abraham's obedience to God, shown by his readiness to sacrifice his son Ishmael. 26- What is Sharia? Sharia is the comprehensive Muslim law derived from two sources, a) the Quran b) the Sunnah or traditions of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). It covers every aspect of daily individual and collective living. The purpose of Islamic laws are protection of individuals' basic human rights to include right to life, property, political and religious freedom and safeguarding the rights of women and minorities. The low crime rate in Muslim societies is due to the application of the Islamic laws. (1) ___________________________ 1-www:Islamichotline.com 27- Was Islam spread by the sword? According to the Quran, \"There is no compulsion in religion\" (2:256), thus, no one can be forced to become a Muslim. While it is true that in many places where Muslim armies went to liberate people or the land, they did carry the sword as that was the weapon used at that time. However, Islam did not spread by the sword because in many places where there are Muslims now, in the Far East like Indonesia, in China, and many parts of Africa, there are no records of any Muslim armies going there. To say that Islam was spread by the sword would be to say that Christianity was spread by guns, F-16's and atomic bombs, etc., which is not true. Christianity spread by the missionary works of Christians. Ten-percent of all Arabs are Christians. The \"Sword of Islam\" could not convert all the non-Muslim minorities in Muslim countries. In India, where Muslims ruled for 700 years, they are still a minority. In the U.S.A., Islam is the fastest growing religion and has 6 million followers without any sword around. 28- Does Islam promote violence and terrorism? No. Islam is religion of peace and submission and stresses on the sanctity of human life. A verse in the Quran says, [Chapter 5, verse 32], that \"anyone who saves one life, it is as if he has saved the whole of mankind and anyone who has killed another person (except in lieu of murder or mischief on earth) it is as if he has killed the whole of mankind.\" Islam condemns all the violence which happened in the Crusades, in Spain, in WW II, or by acts of people like the Rev. Jim Jones, David Koresh, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, or the atrocities committed in Bosnia by the Christian Serbs. Anyone who is doing violence is not practicing his religion at that time. However, sometimes violence is a human response of oppressed people as it happens in Palestine. Although this is wrong, they think of this as a way to get attention. There is a lot of terrorism and violence in areas where there is no Muslim presence. For example, in Ireland, South Africa, Latin America, and Sri Lanka. Sometimes the violence is due to a struggle between those who have with those who do not have, or between those who are oppressed with those who are oppressors. We need to find out why people become terrorists. Unfortunately, the Palestinians who are doing violence are called terrorists, but not the armed Israeli settlers when they do the same sometimes even against their own people. As it turned out to be in the Oklahoma City bombing, sometime Muslims are prematurely blamed even if the terrorism is committed by non-Muslims. Sometimes those who want Peace and those who oppose Peace can be of the same religion. 29- What is \"Islamic Fundamentalism\"? There is no concept of \"Fundamentalism\" in Islam. The western media has coined this term to brand those Muslims who wish to return to the basic fundamental principles of Islam and mould their lives accordingly. Islam is a religion of moderation and a practicing God fearing Muslim can neither be a fanatic nor an extremist. 30-Is Islamic marriage like Christian marriage? In Islam, marriage is one of the most sacred bonds that two humans can forge. In addition, a marriage in Islam is also practical involving legal agreement and contractual obligations which spouses mutually agreed upon. According to Islam, no Muslim girl or boy can be forced to marry against their will. Parents are to play a proactive and active role in suggesting potential spouses, but not to impose a decision upon their children. 31- Does Islam promote polygamy? No, polygamy in Islam is a permission not an injunction. Historically, all the prophets except Jesus, who was not married, had more than one wife. For Muslim men to have more than one wife is a permission which is given to them in the Quran, not to satisfy lust, but for the welfare of the widows and the orphans of the wars. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to have many wives. One person had 11 wives and when he became Muslim, he asked the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), \"What should I do with so many wives?\" and he said, \"Divorce all except the four.\" The Quran says, \"you can marry 2 or 3 and up to 4 women if you can be equally just with each of them\" (4:3). Since it is very difficult to be equally just with all wives, in practice, most of the Muslim men do not have more than one wife. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) himself from age 24 to 50 was married to only one woman, Khadija. In the western society, some men who have one wife have many extramarital affairs. Thus, a survey was published in \"U.S.A. Today\" (April 4, 1988 Section D) which asked 4,700 mistresses what they would like their status to be. They said that \"they preferred being a second wife rather than the 'other woman' because they did not have the legal rights, nor did they have the financial equality of the legally married wives, and it appeared that they were being used by these men.\" 32- Does Islam oppress women? No. On the contrary, Islam elevated the status of women 1,400 years ago by giving them the right to divorce, the right to have financial independence and support and the right to be identified as dignified women (Hijab) when in the rest of the world, including Europe, women had no such rights. Women are equal to men in all acts of piety (Quran 33:32). Islam allows women to keep their maiden name after marriage, their earned money and spend it as they wish, and ask men to be their protector as women on the street can be molested. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) told Muslim men, \"the best among you is the one who is best to his family.\" Not Islam, but some Muslim men, do oppress women today. This is because of their cultural habits or their ignorance about their religion. 33- Is Islam intolerant of other religious minorities? Islam recognizes the rights of the minority. To ensure their welfare and safety, Muslim rulers initiated a tax (Jazia) on them. Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) forbade Muslim armies to destroy churches and synagogues. Caliph Umer did not even allow them to pray inside a church. Jews were welcomed and flourished in Muslim Spain even when they were persecuted in the rest of Europe. They consider that part of their history as the Golden Era. In Muslim countries, Christians live in prosperity, hold government positions and attend their church. However, the same religious tolerance is not always available to Muslim minorities as seen in the past during Spanish inquisition and the crusades, or as seen now by the events in Bosnia, Israel and India. Muslims do recognize that sometimes the actions of a ruler does not reflect the teachings of his religion. 34- What is the Islamic view on- a. Dating and Premarital sex: Islam does not approve of intimate mixing of the sexes, and forbids premarital or extramarital sex. Islam encourages marriage as a shield to such temptations and as a means of having mutual love, mercy and peace. b. Abortion: Islam considers abortion as murder and does not permit it except to save the mother's life (Quran 17:23-31, 6:15 1). c. Homosexuality and AIDS: Islam categorically opposes homosexuality and considers it a sin. However, Muslim physicians are advised to care for AIDS patients with compassion just as they would for other patients. d. Euthanasia and Suicide: Islam is opposed to both suicide and euthanasia. Muslims do not believe in heroic measures to prolong the misery in a terminally ill patient. e. Organ transplantation: Islam stresses upon saving lives (Quran 5:32); thus, transplantation in general would be considered permissible in necessity provided a donor consent is available. The sale of the organ is not allowed. 35- How should Muslims treat Jews and Christians? The Quran calls them \"People of the Book\", i.e., those who received Divine scriptures before Muhammad (Peace be upon him) . Muslims are told to treat them with respect and justice and do not fight with them unless they initiate hostilities or ridicule their faith. The Muslims ultimate hope is that they all will join them in worshipping one God and submit to His will. \"Say (O Muhammad): O people of the Book (Jews and Christians) come to an agreement between us and you, that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall take no partners with Him, and none of us shall take others for Lords beside Allah. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are those who have surrendered (unto Him).\" (Quran 3:64) What about Hindus, Bahai, Buddhists and members of other religions? They should also be treated with love, respect, and understanding to make them recipients of Invitations to Islam. 36-How does Islam guarantee human rights? Freedom of conscience is laid down by the Qur\u2019an itself: \u2018There is no compulsion in religion\u2019. (2:256) The life and property of all citizens in an Islamic state are considered sacred whether a person is Muslim or not. \u2018O mankind! We created you from a single soul, male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, so that you may come to know one another. Truly, the most honored of you in Allah\u2019s sight is\u00a0the greatest of you in piety. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (49:13) 37-Why is the family so important to Muslims? The family is the foundation of Islamic society. The peace and security offered by a stable family unit is greatly valued, and seen as essential for the spiritual growth of its members. A harmonious social order is created by the existence of extended families; children are treasured, and rarely leave home until the time they marry. 38-How do Muslims treat the elderly? In the Islamic world there are no old people\u2019s homes. The strain of caring for one\u2019s parents in this most\u00a0difficult time of their lives is considered an honor and blessing, and an opportunity for great spiritual\u00a0growth. God asks that we not only pray for our parents, but act with limitless compassion,\u00a0remembering that when we were helpless children they preferred us to themselves. Mothers are particularly honored: the Prophet (Peace be upon him) taught that \u2018Paradise lies at the feet of mothers\u2019. When they reach old age, Muslim parents are treated mercifully, with the same kindness and\u00a0selflessness. In Islam, serving one\u2019s parents is a duty second only to prayer, and it is their right to expect it. The Qur\u2019an says: \u2018Your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him, and be kind to parents. If either or both of them reach old age with you, do not say \u2018Uff\u2019 to them or chide them, but speak to\u00a0them in terms of honor and kindness. Treat them with humility, and say, \u2018My Lord! Have mercy on\u00a0them, for they cared for me when I was little\u2019. (17:23-4) 39-What about food? Although much simpler than the dietary law followed by Jews and the early Christians, the code which Muslims observe forbids the consumption of pig meat or any kind of intoxicating drink. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that 'your body has rights over you', and the consumption of wholesome food and the leading of a healthy lifestyle are seen as religious obligations. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'Ask God for certainty [of faith] and well-being; for after certainty, no one is given any gift better than health!' 40-Can anyone become a Muslim? Yes anyone can. There are two declarations, which are necessary: 1- To bear witness that no one deserves to be worshiped except Allah. 2- To bear witness that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah. This makes a person Muslim. But it should be said in Arabic. Next a person takes a shower is recommendable . Then what? After a person becomes Muslim s/he is taught about prayers, fasting, alms to the poor, and pilgrimage. These are the pillars of Islam. Then what? Muslims are brothers and sisters. A Muslim should love for his brother or sister what s/he loves for him/herself. Allah's wealth does not run out and Allah can provide for us all. We pray for each other, and love each other, and love for our brothers and sisters what we love for ourselves.

                    "Age, Race, Class and Sex: Women Redefining Difference Audre Lorde Paper delivered at the Copeland Colloquium, Amerst College, April 1980 Reproduced in: Sister Outsider Crossing Press, California 1984 Much of Western European history conditions us to see hu\u200bman differences in simplistic opposition to each other: dom\u200binant/subordinate, good/bad, up/down, superior/inferior. In a society where the good is defined in terms of profit rather than in terms of human need, there must always be some group of people who, through systematized oppression, can be made to feel surplus, to occupy the place of the dehumanized inferior. Within this society, that group is made up of Black and Third World people, working-class people, older people, and women. As a forty-nine-year-old Black lesbian feminist socialist mother of two, including one boy, and a member of an inter\u200bracial couple, I usually find myself a part of some group defined as other, deviant, inferior, or just plain wrong. Traditionally, in american society, it is the members of oppressed, objectified groups who are expected to stretch out and bridge the gap be\u200btween the actualities of our lives and the consciousness of our oppressor. For in order to survive, those of us for whom oppres\u200bsion is as american as apple pie have always had to be watchers, to become familiar with the language and manners of the op\u200bpressor, even sometimes adopting them for some illusion of pro\u200btection. Whenever the need for some pretense of communica\u200btion arises, those who profit from our oppression call upon us to share our knowledge with them. In other words, it is the respon\u200bsibility of the oppressed to teach the oppressors their mistakes. I am responsible for educating teachers who dismiss my children's culture in school. Black and Third World people are expected to educate white people as to our humanity. Women are expected to educate men. Lesbians and gay men are expected to educate the heterosexual world. The oppressors maintain their position and evade responsibility for their own actions. There is a con\u200bstant drain of energy which might be better used in redefining ourselves and devising realistic scenarios for altering the present and constructing the future. Institutionalized rejection of difference is an absolute necessity in a profit economy which needs outsiders as surplus people. As members of such an economy, we have all been programmed to respond to the human differences between us with fear and loathing and to handle that difference in one of three ways: ig\u200bnore it, and if that is not possible, copy it if we think it is domi\u200bnant, or destroy it if we think it is subordinate. But we have no patterns for relating across our human differences as equals. As a result, those differences have been misnamed and misused in the service of separation and confusion. Certainly there are very real differences between us of race, age, and sex. But it is not those differences between us that are separating us. It is rather our refusal to recognize those dif\u200bferences, and to examine the distortions which result from our misnaming them and their effects upon human behavior and expectation. Racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance. Sexism, the belief in the in\u200bherent superiority of one sex over the other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism. It is a lifetime pursuit for each one of us to extract these distor\u200btions from our living at the same time as we recognize, reclaim, and define those differences upon which they are imposed. For we have all been raised in a society where those distortions were endemic within our living. Too often, we pour the energy need\u200bed for recognizing and exploring difference into pretending those differences are insurmountable barriers, or that they do not exist at all. This results in a voluntary isolation, or false and treacherous connections. Either way, we do not develop tools for using human difference as a springboard for creative change within our lives. We speak not of human difference, but of human deviance. Somewhere, on the edge of consciousness, there is what I call a mythical norm, which each one of us within our hearts knows \"that is not me.\" In america, this norm is usually defined as white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, and financial\u200bly secure. It is with this mythical norm that the trappings of power reside within this society. Those of us who stand outside that power often identify one way in which we are different, and we assume that to be the primary cause of all oppression, forget\u200bting other distortions around difference, some of which we ourselves may be practising. By and large within the women's movement today, white women focus upon their oppression as women and ignore differences of race, sexual preference, class, and age. There is a pretense to a homogeneity of experience covered by the word sisterhood that does not in fact exist. Unacknowledged class differences rob women of each others' energy and creative insight. Recently a women's magazine col\u200blective made the decision for one issue to print only prose, say\u200bing poetry was a less \"rigorous\" or \"serious\" art form. Yet even the form our creativity takes is often a class issue. Of all the art forms, poetry is the most economical. It is the one which is the most secret, which requires the least physical labor, the least material, and the one which can be done between shifts, in the hospital pantry, on the subway, and on scraps of surplus paper. Over the last few years, writing a novel on tight finances, I came to appreciate the enormous differences in the material demands between poetry and prose. As we reclaim our literature, poetry has been the major voice of poor, working class, and Colored women. A room of one's own may be a necessity for writing prose, but so are reams of paper, a typewriter, and plenty of time. The actual requirements to produce the visual arts also help determine, along class lines, whose art is whose. In this day of inflated prices for material, who are our sculptors, our painters, our photographers? When we speak of a broadly based women's culture, we need to be aware of the effect of class and economic differences on the supplies available for producing art. As we move toward creating a society within which we can each flourish, ageism is another distortion of relationship which interferes without vision. By ignoring the past, we are encour\u200baged to repeat its mistakes. The \"generation gap\" is an important social tool for any repressive society. If the younger members of a community view the older members as contemptible or suspect or excess, they will never be able to join hands and ex\u200bamine the living memories of the community, nor ask the all im\u200bportant question, \"Why?\" This gives rise to a historical amnesia that keeps us working to invent the wheel every time we have to go to the store for bread. We find ourselves having to repeat and relearn the same old lessons over and over that our mothers did because we do not pass on what we have learned, or because we are unable to listen. For instance, how many times has this all been said before? For another, who would have believed that once again our daughters are allowing their bodies to be hampered and purgatoried by girdles and high heels and hobble skirts? Ignoring the differences of race between women and the im\u200bplications of those differences presents the most serious threat to the mobilization of women's joint power. As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of their own experience alone, then women of Color become \"other,\" the outsider whose experience and tradition is too \"alien\" to comprehend. An example of this is the signal absence of the experience of women of Color as a resource for women's studies courses. The literature of women of Color is seldom included in women's literature courses and almost never in other literature courses, nor in women's studies as a whole. All too often, the excuse given is that the literatures of women of Color can only be taught by Colored women, or that they are too difficult to understand, or that classes cannot \u201cget into\u201d them because they come out of experiences that are \u201ctoo different.\u201d I have heard this argument presented by white women of otherwise quite clear intelligence, women who seem to have no trouble at all teaching and reviewing work that comes out of the vastly different experiences of Shakespeare, Moliere, Dostoyefsky, and Aristophanes. Surely there must be some other explanation. This is a very complex question, but I believe one of the reasons white women have such difficulty reading Black women's work is because of their reluctance to see Black women as women and different from themselves. To examine Black women's literature effectively requires that we be seen as whole people in our actual complexities \u2014 as individuals, as women, as human \u2014 rather than as one of those problematic but familiar stereotypes provided in this society in place of genunine images of Black women. And I believe this holds true for the literatures of other women of Color who are not Black. The literatures of all women of Color recreate the textures of our lives, and many white women are heavily invested in ignor\u200bing the real differences. For as long as any difference between us means one of us must be inferior, then the recognition of any difference must be fraught with guilt. To allow women of Color to step out of stereotypes is too guilt provoking, for it threatens the complacency of those women who view oppression only in terms of sex. Refusing to recognize difference makes it impossible to see the different problems and pitfalls facing us as women. Thus, in a patriarchal power system where whiteskin privilege is a major prop, the entrapments used to neutralize Black women and white women are not the same. For example, it is easy for Black women to be used by the power structure against Black men, not because they are men, but because they are Black. Therefore, for Black women, it is necessary at all times to separate the needs of the oppressor from our own legitimate conflicts within our communities. This same problem does not exist for white women. Black women and men have shared racist oppression and still share it, although in different ways. Out of that shared oppression we have developed joint defenses and joint vulnerabilities to each other that are not duplicated in the white community, with the exception of the relationship between Jewish women and Jewish men. On the other hand, white women face the pitfall of being seduced into joining the oppressor under the pretense of sharing power. This possibility does not exist in the same way for women of Color. The tokenism that is sometimes extended to us is not an invitation to join power; our racial \"otherness\" is a visible reality that makes that quite clear. For white women there is a wider range of pretended choices and rewards for iden\u200btifying with patriarchal power and its tools. Today, with the defeat of ERA, the tightening economy, and increased conservatism, it is easier once again for white women to believe the dangerous fantasy that if you are good enough, pretty enough, sweet enough, quiet enough, teach the children to behave, hate the right people, and marry the right men, then you will be allowed to co-exist with patriarchy in relative peace, at least until a man needs your job or the neighborhood rapist happens along. And true, unless one lives and loves in the trenches it is difficult to remember that the war against dehu\u200bmanization is ceaseless. But Black women and our children know the fabric of our lives is stitched with violence and with hatred, that there is no rest. We do not deal with it only on the picket lines, or in dark midnight alleys, or in the places where we dare to verbalize our resistance. For us, increasingly, violence weaves through the daily tissues of our living \u2014 in the supermarket, in the classroom, in the elevator, in the clinic and the schoolyard, from the plumber, the baker, the saleswoman, the bus driver, the bank teller, the waitress who does not serve us. Some problems we share as women, some we do not. You fear your children will grow up to join the patriarchy and testify against you, we fear our children will be dragged from a car and shot down in the street, and you will turn your backs upon the reasons they are dying. The threat of difference has been no less blinding to people of Color. Those of us who are Black must see that the reality of our lives and our struggle does not make us immune to the er\u200brors of ignoring and misnaming difference. Within Black com\u200bmunities where racism is a living reality, differences among us often seem dangerous and suspect. The need for unity is often misnamed as a need for homogeneity, and a Black feminist vi\u200bsion mistaken for betrayal of our common interests as a people. Because of the continuous battle against racial erasure that Black women and Black men share, some Black women still refuse to recognize that we are also oppressed as women, and that sexual hostility against Black women is practiced not only by the white racist society, but implemented within our Black communities as well. It is a disease striking the heart of Black nationhood, and silence will not make it disappear. Exacerbated by racism and the pressures of powerlessness, violence against Black women and children often becomes a standard within our communities, one by which manliness can be measured. But these woman-hating acts are rarely discussed as crimes against Black women. As a group, women of Color are the lowest paid wage earners in america. We are the primary targets of abortion and steriliza\u200btion abuse, here and abroad. In certain parts of Africa, small girls are still being sewed shut between their legs to keep them docile and for men's pleasure. This is known as female circumci\u200bsion, and it is not a cultural affair as the late Jomo Kenyatta in\u200bsisted, it is a crime against Black women. Black women's literature is full of the pain of frequent assault, not only by a racist patriarchy, but also by Black men. Yet the necessity for and history of shared battle have made us, Black women, particularly vulnerable to the false accusation that anti-sexist is anti-Black. Meanwhile, womanhating as a recourse of the powerless is sapping strength from Black communities, and our very lives. Rape is on the increase, reported and unreported, and rape is not aggressive sexuality, it is sexualized aggression. As Kalamu ya Salaam, a Black male writer points out, \"As long as male domination exists, rape will exist. Only women revolting and men made conscious of their responsibility to fight sexism can collectively stop rape.\" Differences between ourselves as Black women are also being misnamed and used to separate us from one another. As a Black lesbian feminist comfortable with the many different ingre\u200bdients of my identity, and a woman committed to racial and sexual freedom from oppression, I find I am constantly being en\u200bcouraged to pluck out some one aspect of myself and present this as the meaningful whole, eclipsing or denying the other parts of self. But this is a destructive and fragmenting way to live. My fullest concentration of energy is available to me only when I integrate all the parts of who I am, openly, allowing power from particular sources of my living to flow back and forth freely through all my different selves, without the restric\u200btions of externally imposed definition. Only then can I bring myself and my energies as a whole to the service of those strug\u200bgles which I embrace as part of my living. A fear of lesbians, or of being accused of being a lesbian, has led many Black women into testifying against themselves. It has led some of us into destructive alliances, and others into despair and isolation. In the white women's communities, heterosexism is sometimes a result of identifying with the white patriarchy, a rejection of that interdependence between women-identified women which allows the self to be, rather than to be used in the service of men. Sometimes it reflects a die-hard belief in the pro\u200btective coloration of heterosexual relationships, sometimes a self-hate which all women have to fight against, taught us from birth. Although elements of these attitudes exist for all women, there are particular resonances of heterosexism and homopho\u200bbia among Black women. Despite the fact that woman-bonding has a long and honorable history in the African and African\u200bamerican communities, and despite the knowledge and ac\u200bcomplishments of many strong and creative women-identified Black women in the political, social and cultural fields, heterosexual Black women often tend to ignore or discount the existence and work of Black lesbians. Part of this attitude has come from an understandable terror of Black male attack within the close confines of Black society, where the punish\u200bment for any female self-assertion is still to be accused of being a lesbian and therefore unworthy of the attention or support of the scarce Black male. But part of this need to misname and ig\u200bnore Black lesbians comes from a very real fear that openly women-identified Black women who are no longer dependent upon men for their self-definition may well reorder our whole concept of social relationships. Black women who once insisted that lesbianism was a white woman's problem now insist that Black lesbians are a threat to Black nationhood, are consorting with the enemy, are basically un-Black. These accusations, coming from the very women to whom we look for deep and real understanding, have served to keep many Black lesbians in hiding, caught between the racism of white women and the homophobia of their sisters. Often, their work has been ignored, trivialized, or misnamed, as with the work of Angelina Grimke, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Lorraine Hansberry. Yet women-bonded women have always been some part of the power of Black communities, from our unmarried aunts to the amazons of Dahomey. And it is certainly not Black lesbians who are assaulting women and raping children and grandmothers on the streets of our communities. Across this country, as in Boston during the spring of 1979 following the unsolved murders of twelve Black women, Black lesbians are spearheading movements against violence against Black women. What are the particular details within each of our lives that can be scrutinized and altered to help bring about change? How do we redefine difference for all women? It is not our differences which separate women, but our reluctance to recognize those differences and to deal effectively with the distortions which have resulted from the ignoring and misnaming of those dif\u200bferences. As a tool of social control, women have been encouraged to recognize only one area of human difference as legitimate, those differences which exist between women and men. And we have learned to deal across those differences with the urgency of all oppressed subordinates. All of us have had to learn to live or work or coexist with men, from our fathers on. We have recognized and negotiated these differences, even when this recognition only continued the old dominant/subordinate mode of human relationship; where the oppressed must recognize the masters' difference in order to survive. But our future survival is predicated upon our ability to relate within equality. As women, we must root out internalized pat\u200bterns of oppression within ourselves if we are to move beyond the most superficial aspects of social change. Now we must recognize differences among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each others' dif\u200bference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles. The future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference. The old definitions have not served us, nor the earth that supports us. The old pat\u200bterns, no matter how cleverly rearranged to imitate progress, still condemn us to cosmetically altered repetitions of the same old exchanges, the same old guilt, hatred, recrimination, lamen\u200btation, and suspicion. For we have, built into all of us, old blueprints of expectation and response, old structures of oppression, and these must be altered at the same time as we alter the living conditions which are a result of those structures. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. As Paulo Freire shows so well in The Pedagogy of the Oppressed, the true focus of revolutionary change is never merely the oppressive situations which we seek to escape, but that piece of the oppressor which is planted deep within each of us, and which knows only the oppressors' tactics, the op\u200bpressors' relationships. Change means growth, and growth can be painful. But we sharpen self-definition by exposing the self in work and struggle together with those whom we define as different from ourselves, although sharing the same goals. For Black and white, old and young, lesbian and heterosexual women alike, this can mean new paths to our survival. We have chosen each other and the edge of each others battles the war is the same if we lose someday women's blood will congeal upon a dead planet if we win there is no telling we seek beyond history for a new and more possible meeting."

                    "LYSISTRATA: (Pronounced both ways, Liz-IS-trata and Lyzis-TRA-ta, Lysistrata is an anti-war comedy written by the fifth century Greek comic playwright Aristophanes.) Anti-War Sex Strike Lysistrata: And not so much as the shadow of a lover! Since the day the Milesians betrayed us, I have never once seen an eight-inch gadget even, to be a leathern consolation to us poor widows.... Now tell me, if I have discovered a means of ending the war, will you all second me? Cleonice: Yes verily, by all the goddesses, I swear I will, though I have to put my gown in pawn, and drink the money the same day. .... Lysistrata: Then I will out with it at last, my mighty secret! Oh! sister women, if we would compel our husbands to make peace, we must refrain... -Lysistrata selection from EAWC Anthology Lysistrata Plot The basic plot of Lysistrata is that the women barricade themselves in the acropolis and go on a sex strike to persuade their husbands to stop the Peloponnesian War. Fantastic Reversal of Societal Norms This is fantasy, of course, and was even more improbable at a time when women didn't have the vote and men had ample opportunities to whet their sexual appetites elsewhere. \"The sexual theme is just an attention-grabber. ... [T]he comedy neatly inverts spaces and boundaries -- the women turn the city into an extended household and seize control of the actual polis -- not as \"intruders\" but as reconcilers and healers. He [sc. Konstan] demonstrates how the women's visions and concepts surpass the fractious politics and warfare of the men.\" - From BMCR review of David Konstan's Greek Comedy and Ideology Making Lysistrata even more far-fetched, according to Brian Arkins in \"Sexuality in Fifth-Century Athens\", (1994) Classics Ireland, \"an Athenian male could be held incompetent at law for being under the influence of a woman.\" So, had Aristophanes' plot been the historical reality -- since the women actually do get their way -- all the Athenian soldiers might have lost their legal rights for being under their wives' power. Control of the War Chest Lysistrata's band of chaste wives is supplemented by a band of older women who have taken the acropolis in order to deny the soldiers access to the funds they need to wage war. When the Athenian men approach the acropolis, they are surprised by the number and determination of the women. When they express concern that the Spartans will destroy their city, Lysistrata assures them that women are all they need for defense. Women's Work Lysistrata uses an analogy from the mundane world in which ancient women lived to explain how their strategies will work: First you wash the city as we wash the wool, 575 cleaning out the bulls**t. Then we pluck away the parasites; break up strands that clump together, forming special interest groups; Here's a bozo: squeeze his head off. Now you're set to card the wool: use your basket for the carding, the basket of solidarity. 580 There we put our migrant workers, foreign friends, minorities, immigrants and wage-slaves, every person useful to the state. Don't forget our allies, either, languishing like separate strands. Bring it all together now, and 585 make one giant ball of yarn. Now you're ready: weave a brand new suit for all the citizens. - Lysistrata Lysistrata Makes the Peace After a while, the women grow weak with unsatisfied libido. Some claim they need to get home \"to their chores,\" although one is caught trying to escape to a brothel. Lysistrata assures the other women it won't be long; their husbands are in worse shape than they are. Soon men start showing up, trying everything to persuade their women to release them from their pointedly visible torments, but to no avail. Then a Spartan herald arrives to make a treaty. He, too, is very plainly suffering the priapism rampant among Athenian men. Lysistrata acts as go-between Sparta and Athens. After accusing both sides of dishonorable behavior, she persuades the men to agree to stop fighting. Male Female Actors The original comedy manipulated gender roles. Besides women acting like men (having political clout), there were men acting like women (all actors were male). The male characters wore large, erect leather phalluses like the one whose absence (see opening quote) Lysistrata laments. \"The convention of male actors playing female roles does appear to intrude into the text, just as it may have intruded into the performance. Femininity is represented by Aristophanes as the site of the ultimate comic figure: completely deceptive because 'she' is not real at all. 'She' must be given shape by a man, and everyone knows that.\" - From BMCR Review of Taaffe's Aristophanes and Women http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hca/classics/gender.htm) Aristophanes Bibliography From Diotima, scholarly work on Aristophanes. what Aristophanes must have gone through.

The plot is about as simple as it gets: Athenian women, fed up with the Peloponnesian War, barricade themselves in the Acropolis and go on a sex strike to force their husbands to vote for peace with Sparta. This plot demonstrates that the overriding mode of Aristophanic comedy is fantasy. In the Congresswomen women take over the assembly to save Athens from corrupt politicians. So consider that, while in tragedy assertive women cause catastrophe, in comedy they bring joy and harmony. But Aristophanes is not content to turn the tables and present purely virtuous women and venal men; consider why, exactly, they are so upset about the duration of the war. To paraphrase Freud, what do these women really want? Note in the first scene how difficult Lysistrata finds it to interest other women in her plan. Part of the original humorous effect derives from Greek staging practice. Remember that all the actors are male. Also, a prominent part of the comic costume was a large leather phallus. The male characters in this play would walk around the stage with huge erections. This is not a comedy that for prudes. Most of the sexual innuendo that you see in virtually every line is actually there. The name of the play's heroine, Lysistrata, means \"releaser of war,\" which typifies the Aristophanic tendency for an \"outsider\" hero whose indicates his or her function. Interestingly, there was an important priestess in Athens at that time whose name, Lysimache, meant \"releaser of the battle.\" However, it is impossible to say this significance of this possible coincidence. Think about the character of Lysistrata and how the audience might have viewed her. What figure in mythology or tragedy does she most resemble? page 356: If you have trouble understanding the Spartan woman Lampito, read her lines aloud, using a hillbilly accent. The translator is trying to imitate how the Athenians regarded the Spartans as hicks. p382ff. Note how Aristophanes blends the slapstick scene of the women chasing of old men with weapons like weaving spindles and the intellectual humor of the commissioner's attempt to argue with Lysistrata's exposition of the incompetence of the men's pursuit of the war. There are several references to Sicily in the play. Recently Athens had added to its problems by deciding to invade Sicily as well, an expedition that ended in disaster. p408. Lysistrata and the women stage a parody of a typical tragic scene: does it look familiar to you? p436: the koryphaios is the leader of the chorus. The leaders of the two male and female choruses attempt to make amends. Note that the play seems to hoping not just for an end to the Peloponnesian War, but to the proverbial war between the sexes. p.444: note how Aristophanes undercuts the lofty sentiments of Lysistrata's speech to the men. What are the men doing while she is talking about peace? The final pages are taken up with a revel (a typical comic ending) celebrating the new peace. For an audience still at war, this is the ultimate form of escapist entertainment. http://ancienthistory.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=ancienthistory&cdn=education&tm=27&f=00&su=p284.13.342.ip_&tt=2&bt=0&bts=0&zu=http%3A//www.temple.edu/classics/lysistrata.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review 95.11.11 David Konstan, Greek Comedy and Ideology. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. ix + 244. $45.00. ISBN 0-19-509294-5. Reviewed by Ian C. Storey, Greek Drama, Trent University (istorey@trentu.ca). On whatever subject David Konstan writes in the field of classical studies (and beyond), the reader has come to expect elegant and humane discussion of the larger points raised by the ancient texts, the society behind the artist and his works. This recent volume assembles a number of Konstan's previously published papers on comedy (Old, New, and \"modern\" [i.e. Moliere]). This may disquiet those who would be expecting a brand-new monograph on comedy, and the articles do range over a period of thirteen years. But each paper has been revised -- where I was able to check quickly and directly, the revision has been substantial; the opening of the chapter on Wasps and the close of that on Ploutos are newly written to provide an introduction and conclusion to the material on Aristophanes, while the chapter on Dyskolos is almost an entirely new composition. Thus if not an entirely new book on comedy, this work has been recast thoroughly by the author to maintain a consistent overview. The chapter on Frogs (perhaps the most provocative), originally published in French in an out-of-the-way journal, is here translated into English and thus more readily accessible. Konstan deals with Old and Later Comedy in roughly equal parts, Aristophanes represented by essays on Wasps, Birds, Lysistrate, Frogs, and Ploutos (the last a re-working of his joint paper of 1981 with Matthew Dillon), and Menander by discussions of Dyskolos, Perikeiromene, and Epitrepontes. Papers on Terence's Eunuchus and Moliere's The Miser round out this study. I shall content myself with observations on the Aristophanic studies as well as one of the Menandrian where I feel most at home. Konstan's introduction (4) explains his studies of the comedies as \"ideological readings ... [that] look to the ways in which the plays respond to cultural issues\". Literary texts will betray the \"tensions and inequalities of class, gender, and status\" (5), and Konstan seeks out what he calls \"the seams and sutures\" in comedy \"where the fusion of incompatible elements becomes visible\". These \"seams\" take various forms in the comedies under discussion. Sometimes they are changes in the plot-line (as in Birds, Frogs, Ploutos), or in attitudes toward characters (as in Wasps, Ploutos), or in the moral level beneath the comedy (Ploutos), or as in the case of Lysistrate a subtle variation on the well-rehearsed oikos/polis theme. Konstan takes issue with critics such as Heath for whom plot, not ideology, is the comic all in all (5-6); for him the \"lapses in unity\" are not errors of comic craftsmanship but \"the source of the overdetermined structure of the comedies\". If there seems to be a problem (or incongruity or \"seam\"), there must be some authorial or societal reason here. Konstan rejects either loose composition or conscious irony as alternative explanations of such comic incongruity -- especially well put on p. 79. But it is this emphasis on \"seams and sutures\" (at times just large-scale incongruities and inconsistencies) that worries me most about Konstan's various studies. Are they as significant as he maintains, or just part and parcel of the genre or of its particular writers? I suspect that audiences would have been used to this loosely structured and fanciful form of drama, that they did not apply to it the same rigour that we apply to the modern detective novel, that holes in the plot or entirely new lines of action would not have worried an ancient spectator the way they do a modern critic. We do not demand of modern musicals or even of the Marx Brothers' movies that the words of the songs that effectively freeze or break the action have much to do with the plot or the \"meaning\" of the larger whole. This is our expectation; did the ancients actually worry about or even notice the incongruities that we find from reading the plays? Similarly for Aristophanes the \"seams and sutures\" do not have to reflect an ideological tension beneath the comic surface. Incongruity is a well-documented phenomenon in his comedy -- the matter of Philokleon's teeth and Dionysos' change of mission being the best examples. In fact Suss filled three articles with such discrepancies and incongruities. Dover summarises well, \"that what is dramatically suitable at one moment may be rationally irreconcilable with what is presupposed at other moments in the same play\". These discrepancies are characteristic of our poet. Aristophanes simply did not bother about such matters in creating his comic plots and fantasies any more that Gilbert did about the relative ages of his major characters in Pinafore or in any other of these rather Aristophanean musical fantasies. If his mind races from one idea to another, we should perhaps suspend the critical gaze and enjoy the ride. Thus although I find much of what Konstan says about each play interesting and thought-provoking, reaction must be tempered by the consideration that he may be letting too much ride on what may be not as ideologically significant as he maintains. Two other studies from the 1990s (both of which I have reviewed elsewhere) deal with the persona of the comic poet himself, but in two widely differing ways, namely Hubbard's Aristophanes who in the parabatic sections at any rate is an author in firm control of his material and lurking very close to the surface of his comedies, and Bowie's deconstructed Aristophanes who is less an author of crafted dramas than the almost unconscious purveyor of Athenian attitudes to myths and rituals -- early on Bowie (p. 9) disavows any desire \"to seek authorial intent\". Thus faced with this pair of antithetical Aristophanes, I was curious to see what sort of comedian would emerge from Konstan's study. The historical critic for whom authorial intent is not the lost cause that Bowie and others imagine will be at first dismayed to read Konstan's denial of a programmatic intent (6) with his declaration \"there is no unambiguous 'Aristophanes' within the texts\" and his careful avoidance (8) of the author in favour of the effects created by the comedies. But in this respect the introduction (3-11) seems somewhat at odds with the various chapters in which Konstan does allow for a creative comedian at work. In particular the last pages of the study of Wasps (26-8) do allow for the poet's own ideological stance, and for his personal view of the jury-system. And the discussion of Frogs frequently focuses on the author's intentions (to the tragedians in general, to Aeschylus in particular, to the status of citizens, to the purpose of the poet in a city). Perhaps above all, in Ploutos Konstan sees the conscious comedian at work. However the emphasis still tends to lie with the plays and the effects they create; we do see an Aristophanes at work, but one rather closer to Bowie's deconstructed comedian than to Hubbard's visible author. WASPS -- The principal thrust of Konstan's first discussion hinges on the point that the old men are not wholly in the wrong nor are their characters and attitudes reprehensible. Their orge, their most distinguishing feature as jurors, is praiseworthy in the description of their valour in Persian War times. As I read Konstan's argument, it is not that orge itself is bad, but only as applied to the occupation as jurors. This brings him to the same conclusion as de Ste Croix, that Aristophanes is out to discredit the whole system, but with a less purely partisan bias. Aristophanes is contrasting youth and age, rich and poor, polypragmosyne and apragmosyne in a fashion that elevates earlier values above modern (i.e. popular) realities. On this reasoning Wasps fits well with the reversed ending of Knights or with the parabasis of Frogs or the ending of Lysistrate. On p. 17 Konstan finds it \"odd\" that common sense and conservative values are assigned to a young man, but reversal of generational roles is common in comedies of the 420s (cf. Clouds, Eupolis' Goats) and given the virtual identification of Bdelykleon with Aristophanes at 650ff., we can see the young comedian himself behind one of his main characters -- note the eloquent send-off for Bdelykleon at 1450ff. I was pleased to see that Konstan treats both characters as principals, as opposed to Whitman, Reckford, and Bowie for whom Philokleon is the only character worthy of consideration. On the whole this is a solid discussion, even if the final comments (27-8) about class and citizen-status are less compelling. BIRDS -- I was less happy with this chapter. Birds has been a difficult comedy to write well on, and often open to excesses of political and metaphysical interpretation. Konstan canvasses a number of the political interpretations (30-2), ranging from Suvern's pure allegory to Arrowsmith's \"warning to the Athenians\", but stops short of Whitman's (and Sommerstein's, although not directly cited) rejection of a political reading. Here he distinguishes between four types of imaginary society (anomia, antinomia, megalonomia, eunomia) and shows how Nephelokokkygia is composed of features of all four. I am not sure how relevant all this is, since apart from the importance of nomoi to the ancient concept of society, these are essentially modern terms and the \"seams\" and overlaps may be significant to modern theorists, but do not help with appreciating what Aristophanes was trying to do with his play. He will argue at the end (44) that Cloudcuckooland is a \"complex image of Athens' own contradictions\", but essentially avoids any comment on Aristophanes' own standpoint. The comedy contains perhaps an irreconcilable blend of ancient utopian vision and modern imperial designs, but whether there is anything beyond excellent comic fantasy is still open to debate. LYSISTRATE -- A subtle discussion of gender roles and of the familiar antithesis of oikos / polis. Konstan's first \"seam\" is the shift from the women as motivated by sexual desire to their defence of marriage and the household, but on p. 49 offers a reasonable explanation (\"the women's randiness makes for some good fun at the women's expense\") that should suffice. Prologues are essentially \"warm-ups\" for the comedian and audience -- this is especially clear in Wasps and Frogs. The sexual theme is just an attention-grabber. What Konstan does show is that the comedy neatly inverts spaces and boundaries -- the women turn the city into an extended household and seize control of the actual polis -- not as \"intruders\" but as reconcilers and healers. He demonstrates how the women's visions and concepts surpass the fractious politics and warfare of the men. He makes an interesting comparison with Birds, although close in time not the obvious piece to set beside Lysistrate, in that Birds shows us a new idea (one with admitted older and utopian overtones) fully realised -- a brand-new order is created -- while Lysistrate is a total inversion of the great idea, a restoration of a past state of affairs (ironically one that breaks up the unity of the women into domestic units once again). He comments aptly, \"the utopian gesture has been recontained\" (60). In this sense Lysistrate can be considered Aristophanes' most conservative comedy. Some points of comment. On p. 47 he stresses the collective nature of the women, but it needs to be stressed that these are all citizen women; there is no hint of the break-down of the barriers between free and slave. On p. 55 he views the situation at Athens in early 411 as \"still desperate\"; but see Henderson for a more optimistic view of affairs. On pp. 55/6 he alludes to the historical reality of a truce between Athens and Sparta; Thucydides 8.68-91 makes it clear that the oligarchs were trying for just such an eventuality. Thus Aristophanes' fantasy coincides with one part of an extreme right-wing campaign. Finally on p. 59 he discusses the body-scenes at the beginning and close of the play -- \"Lysistrata herself, acting as a kind of pander\" -- describing the women's sexual play as \"gentle and integrative\". Not all have agreed; see Bella Zweig's discussion of the same scenes for a very different interpretation. FROGS -- This is probably the most interesting and provocative piece in the collection. He begins from the well-known discrepancy between Dionysos' original intent to bring back Euripides and his later decision to bring back the winner of the contest. He canvasses explanations of external and internal significance, without allowing for the pure inconsistency of an Aristophanic comedy -- at 737ff. the play seems just to start over with a new prologue. His first question is \"Why Heracles?\" [i.e. why should Dionysos disguise himself as Herakles?]. Quite frankly, the explanation to my mind is likely to be the frequent appearance of both in comedy and satyr-play; by combining the two Aristophanes can get the best of both stereotypes. In his n.6 he cautiously suggests that Dionysos' mission in search of Euripides is rather analogous to that of Herakles for Kerberos. I think that there is more here than Konstan allows. His own answer is that Herakles was \"chosen because he was a mortal and had become a god\". This leads to his first major interpretative theme, salvation/resurrection. He insists on a tripartite division for the comedy (the scenes on the descent [Herakles], the scenes before the door [the Initiates], the contest between the poets), and argues that each provides a manner of resurrection: Herakles = salvation by individual and active heroism, the Initiates by an almost passive state-of-being, the poets by confrontation and political utility. On p. 64 he amusingly suggests that these correspond to the numbers of Greek verbs (singular, plural, and dual) -- it would be interesting to explore whether the latter part of Frogs contains more uses of the dual than one would expect. The weakest argument is his analysis of the middle scene, for it is not quite accurate to say that the Initiates are purely passive, for they do act (the act of Initiation) and do lead a certain life, and the scenes with Dionysos and Xanthias at the door have really little to do with the Initiates who recede into the background. In fact the Initiates frame this scene with their parodos and parabasis -- Konstan acknowledges this on p. 69 -- but don't do much more than comment. So far, so good, but I am less keen on his relation of the tripartite structure and the three means of \"salvation\" to the three phases of the rites of passage (separation, margin, and aggregation). This turns the play into a rite of passage for Dionysos (why?), or at least provides a sub-text of the ritual of the rite of passage, in the same way that Bowie has argued for much of Aristophanes. And here I am no more convinced than I was with Bowie's book. Konstan does, however, proceed to make some quite good points about the citizen/slave theme in the play (the enfranchisement of the slaves after Arginousai, the atimoi of the parabasis), and detects a nice \"seam\" in that slaves can become citizens by sharing the city's perils and the atimoi can become whole citizens again, but creatures like Kleophon are in reality \"aliens\"; here the citizen/barbarian barrier is firmly raised again. On the contest between the poets, he sees Aristophanes as showing that Euripides' art represents reality while Aeschylus' can shape it (72). Here he stresses the ultimate political responsibility of the poet, and demonstrates how it fits in with Aristophanes' conservative and utopian creations elsewhere. In his n.41 he cites Heiden who makes the very good point that perhaps neither provided ultimate soteria, for can we not argue that while Euripides possesses sophia and Aeschylus political usefulness, if you want a poet with both, then turn to comedy? PLOUTOS -- A strong chapter in which Konstan sees an active comic poet (not so much one with a particular agenda, but one in conscious control of his material). This play has suffered a variety of modern assessments, ranging from those who see it as just an uninspired or unsuccessful fantasy, to the genuine change of heart on the poet's part, to the ironists who see the latter half undercutting the first. Konstan really falls into none of these, although on p.84 he comes close to an ironic interpretation (denied, however, on p. 79). He distinguishes three \"seams\" in the play: (1) the very distinct change in plot-line, from a redistribution based on moral criteria to the remedy for the scarcity of wealth, (2) a switch in the scene with the sycophant from moral issues to a discussion of activity v. apragmosyne, and (3) exactly what is required, the mere presence of Wealth or the regaining of Wealth's sight. Both (1) and (3) progress from one pole to the other in the course of the play. On his last pages Konstan suggests that Aristophanes is deliberately muddying the waters of the class struggle in the early 4th c. by offering \"the ancient dream of limitless bounty\" and the inconsistencies in the text are not flaws or evidence of irony, but \"the signs of tensions immanent in ideology and social reality that are overcome facetiously in the production of the unified text\" (90). My first observation is the one made earlier that \"shifts in strategy\" may just be another way of saying \"looseness in composition\" and need not be as significant as Konstan maintains; there is still much to be said for the first of the views mentioned above (a less than successful fantasy). The third \"seam\" may not be all that contradictory; we could look at it as a progression -- Ploutos when blind must be led physically into one's house, but with sight regained he becomes active and makes his own way. The metaphor of movement and progress is one of major importance in this comedy. On the infamous agon with Penia, he rightly questions Sommerstein's critique of Penia, but could (I think) pursue this farther, since the unique defeat of the second speaker (Penia) is one of the major planks in the platform of the ironists. The scene with the sycophant is by no means new with this play -- there are instances in Acharnians and a very close prototype in fr. 99 of Eupolis' Demoi where Aristeides the Just (cf. the Just Man in this scene) confounds a sycophant. Konstan does not, I think, allow for the stereotypes of this scene. In this chapter and in the one on Wasps we see the most active Aristophanes, combining in his comic creations a conservative personal ethos with a popular view of utopia lost. DYSKOLOS -- Although with New Comedy we move from politics and utopia to the realm of the family and of philanthropia, the discussion of Dyskolos has much in common with the Aristophanic chapters in that the principal \"seam\" is the juxtaposition of the two plots, the misanthropy of Knemon and the love plot involving Sostratos the young Athenian. Many critics have seen this as essentially flawed comedy, a youthful effort which ultimately does not work. Konstan rejects this view (100/1) insisting that the two sides of Knemon's character reflect the two different plot strands. In effect he redraws the themes of the play: the misanthropy of Knemon which must be remedied -- Konstan tends to be a bit hard on Knemon with adjectives such as \"ogre-like\" and monstrous\" -- and the clash of values between city and country, where his rustic reserve is perfectly admirable. A few points of contention. There seems to be very little use of Samia in Konstan's discussion, a pity since about four-fifths of the play survive and of far superior quality to that of Dyskolos. On p. 93 he describes Menander's subject as \"the vicissitudes of youthful passion\", but what about the passion of the mature Demeas in Samia? On the same page he finds it odd that Knemon's daughter is the object of eros, as opposed to gamos, arguing that \"it is rarely the case that a maiden girl is known to be a citizen ... and is represented as the object of passionate desire\". Again what about Samia where Moschion has loved and will wed Nikeratos' daughter? We know too little about Menander's vast comic output, I feel, to make such a wide-ranging judgement. Finally am I the only reader who is bothered by the last act, not just in the lack of much significance to the plot-line, but in the unfair treatment of Knemon by the revellers? At the very end (106) Konstan sees the problem -- \"the surly misanthrope is ultimately reduced to a figure of fun\" -- but I wonder if this scene rather undoes the philanthropia which he sees operating elsewhere in the play (104). To conclude, Konstan's discussions are always elegant in their phrasing and subtle in their content. He deals more with the general approach, although he does not neglect the text itself. His Aristophanes is a creative comic poet, not merely the deconstructed purveyor of ideas and ideologies. Yet my principal concern lies in the seriousness with which Konstan treats his \"seams and sutures\"; loose construction or just authorial indifference may just as well account for these inconsistencies. That said, the essays were thought-provoking, and in the case of Wasps, Frogs, and Ploutos deserve to be among the required readings for these comedies. http://ancienthistory.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=ancienthistory&cdn=education&tm=645&f=00&su=p284.13.342.ip_&tt=2&bt=4&bts=0&zu=http%3A//ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1995/95.11.11.html http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/lysistrata/a/lysistrata.htm SLIDE SHARE: http://www.slideshare.net/garethhil/lysistrata-aristotleplotcharactertheme PENGUIN Pub.: http://www.us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/lysistrata.pdf THEMES: Prezi: http://prezi.com/j45wekyldvnr/themes-in-lysistrata/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=prezi_landing_related_solr&utm_campaign=prezi_landing_related_author"
